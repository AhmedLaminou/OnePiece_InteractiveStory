40,Luffy Monkey D.,モンキー・D・ルフィ,"Monkey D., Luffy",https://myanimelist.net/character/40/Luffy_Monkey_D,"[{""name"": ""Age"", ""value"": ""17; 19""}, {""name"": ""Birthdate"", ""value"": ""May 5, Taurus""}, {""name"": ""Height"", ""value"": ""172 cm""}, {""name"": ""Blood type"", ""value"": ""F""}, {""name"": ""Affiliation"", ""value"": ""Straw Hat Pirates""}, {""name"": ""Position"", ""value"": ""Captain""}, {""name"": ""Devil fruit"", ""value"": ""Gomu Gomu no Mi (Gum Gum Fruit),  Hito Hito no Mi (Human Human Fruit: Model Nika)""}, {""name"": ""Type"", ""value"": ""Paramecia,  Mythical Zoan""}, {""name"": ""Bounty"", ""value"": ""3,000,000,000 (previously: 30,000,000, 100,000,000, 300,000,000, 400,000,000, 500,000,000 and 1,500,000,000)""}]","Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and is best friends with all of them and values them over all else. At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in a childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done. Luffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young male hero/adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial ""D."" Although Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism, and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear is towards his grandfather, to the point that he is intimidated at the mere mention of him. Luffy never kills any of his enemies, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or beating them to a point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment. Luffy's dream is to find the One Piece and become Pirate King. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks. Monkey D. Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army and the world's most wanted criminal. His grandfather is ""The Hero of The Marines,"" Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp. Before the start of the series, Dragon left Luffy in Garp's care. Dragon first appears after a lightning bolt suddenly destroys the gallows where Luffy was to be executed by Buggy the Clown and then saves Luffy from being captured by Captain Smoker. When he saved Luffy from Smoker, a mighty gust of eerie wind swept through Loguetown. It is undetermined whether or not he was the cause of the gust of wind or the lightning; however, the story leads to believe there is more to him than it seems. Recently, he has taken over an island in the South Blue and is about to head to the North Blue when he commented, after noticing Luffy's newest bounty, given to him after invading Enies Lobby, that father and son will meet sometime soon."
61,Robin Nico,ニコ・ロビン,"Nico, Robin",https://myanimelist.net/character/61/Robin_Nico,"[{""name"": ""Age"", ""value"": ""28; 30""}, {""name"": ""Birthdate"", ""value"": ""February 6, Aquarius""}, {""name"": ""Height"", ""value"": ""188cm (6'2\"")""}, {""name"": ""Sizes"", ""value"": ""99 - 59 - 89""}, {""name"": ""Affiliation"", ""value"": ""Straw Hat Pirates; Baroque Works (former)""}, {""name"": ""Position"", ""value"": ""Archaeologist""}, {""name"": ""Devil Fruit"", ""value"": ""Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower Fruit)""}, {""name"": ""Type"", ""value"": ""Paramecia""}, {""name"": ""Bounty"", ""value"": ""930,000,000 (previously: 79,000,000; 80,000,000; 130,000,000)""}]","Robin is the seventh member of Straw Hat's Crew. She had a bounty of 79 million beri (One Piece currency)  since she was eight years old, during an incident in which she supposedly destroyed six Buster Call ships through the use of the powers she gained by the eating the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower or Blooming Blooming Fruit). The fruit's power enables her to conjure up multiple replicas of her body parts (most often her arms) upon any surface she is able to see making her very powerful and dexterous as a result. Robin joined the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy saved her life, or (how she states it) Luffy forced her to live when she wanted to die. To atone for his crime, Robin demands that Luffy allow her to join his crew, to which he complies leaving every other crew member except Sanji in shock. Although feared at first, she is quickly accepted and viewed as a comrade by the crew. Robin is actually an archaeologist of talent, and despises anyone who thoughtlessly damages any piece of history. The World Government fears her because she can decipher Poneglyphs (stones marked with glyphs from an ancient language), which contain details capable of reviving ancient weapons that have the power to destroy the world. In reality, Robin has stated that she does not care about ancient weapons, and that her dream is to find the True History written on the Rio Poneglyph. Robin is a mysterious and serious person who appears quiet and reclusive, and the wisest in the Straw Hat's Crew. She was thought by those around her to be cold and mean, but it was proven that she is actually a kind person who always thinks before she acts. She often only speaks when something interesting or important has happened. She loves to study history, and the comfort and freedom to study and read. She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew. She has a vast knowledge of the seas and the world, and usually keeps her head during surprising situations, allowing her to logically analyze the situation without losing her cool. This trait makes her different from the other Straw Hats, who often comically react melodramatically to unexpected happenings and hold irrational ideas and conclusions. Despite her attempts to keep herself distant, Robin has fallen for her new friends, and has taken the role of the distant den mother."
62,Zoro Roronoa,ロロノア・ゾロ,"Roronoa, Zoro",https://myanimelist.net/character/62/Zoro_Roronoa,"[{""name"": ""Age"", ""value"": ""19; 21""}, {""name"": ""Birthdate"", ""value"": ""November 11, Scorpio""}, {""name"": ""Height"", ""value"": ""178 cm (5'10\"") , 181 (5'11\"") (after timeskip)""}, {""name"": ""Affiliation"", ""value"": ""Straw Hat Pirates""}, {""name"": ""Position"", ""value"": ""Swordsman""}, {""name"": ""Devil Fruit"", ""value"": ""None""}, {""name"": ""Bounty"", ""value"": ""1,111,000,000 (previously: 60,000,000, 120,000,000 and 320,000,000)""}]","Zoro was the first crew member to be recruited by Luffy. Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style). This is achieved by using one katana in each hand and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his bandana, normally tied on the arm, on his head. Though not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood. Zoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but, unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him. Zoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he's a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and determined."
64,Franky,フランキー,Franky,https://myanimelist.net/character/64/Franky,"[{""name"": ""Age"", ""value"": ""34; 36""}, {""name"": ""Birthdate"", ""value"": ""March 9""}, {""name"": ""Zodiac Sign"", ""value"": ""Pisces""}, {""name"": ""Height"", ""value"": ""225 cm (7'4½\"")""}, {""name"": ""Affiliation"", ""value"": ""Straw Hat Pirates; Franky Family (former); Tom's Workers (former)""}, {""name"": ""Position"", ""value"": ""Shipwright""}, {""name"": ""Devil Fruit"", ""value"": ""none""}, {""name"": ""Bounty"", ""value"": ""394,000,000 (previously: 44,000,000 and 94,000,000)""}]","Franky is a 34 year old cyborg who is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates and their third most recently recruited member. He first appeared in the Water 7 arc. Franky is one of ""Tom's Workers"", with the original name ""Cutty Flam."" Franky's dream is to build a ship that would travel to the end of the Grand Line. This is the ship that the Straw Hats are currently riding, but his dream is not yet achieved until they make it to the end. Franky usually acts tough and is quickly angered, but he is also very emotional when it comes to sad tales and often bursts into large tears, or on some occasions, plays a song. His most distinguishable personality trait is his flamboyant attitude. He frequently shouts the word 'SUPER' when he's in a positive mood or adds it into his speech. He also has a signature pose which he uses very often. Franky is quick to defend other people (e.g. Franky Family, Nico Robin) and take action if his friends are harmed. He is also quick in making friends, allies, and comrades with even the most unlikely of individuals. Because of this, he is seen as a 'big brother' figure. Monkey D. Luffy bears similar qualities (with the exception of engaging in unnecessary fights) and because of this, despite the disputes the two had in the past, both grew to respect each other during the events of the Enies Lobby Arc."
305,Sanji,サンジ,Sanji,https://myanimelist.net/character/305/Sanji,"[{""name"": ""Age"", ""value"": ""19→21""}, {""name"": ""Birthday"", ""value"": ""March 2""}, {""name"": ""Zodiac"", ""value"": ""Pisces""}, {""name"": ""Height"", ""value"": ""177 cm (5' 9\"") → 180 cm (5'11\"")""}, {""name"": ""Blood type"", ""value"": ""RH-""}, {""name"": ""Affiliation"", ""value"": ""Straw Hat Pirates; Baratie (former)""}, {""name"": ""Position"", ""value"": ""Cook""}, {""name"": ""Devil Fruit"", ""value"": ""none""}, {""name"": ""Bounty"", ""value"": ""1,032,000,000 (previously: 330,000,000 ← 177,000,000 ← 77,000,000)""}]","Sanji is the chain-smoking chef of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew. He has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his cooking skills. Except a single fight where he uses knives against a fellow chef. Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef ""Red Leg"" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue. Sanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his ""love-cook"" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname ""ero-cook,"" or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around women, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can't attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a ""strict upbringing."" To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur. His goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe. Being the crew's chef, he looks out for the health of his crewmates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He's also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well. In short, he cares as much for the crew as any Straw Hat should, but unlike Zoro, Sanji shows these feelings more. It is revealed that Sanji is the third son of the Vinsmokes, a family of killers. His father and one of the Yonkou, Big Mom, had arranged a marriage between him and the 35th daughter of the Charlotte family, Pudding during the strawhats time on Zoe/Dressrosa."

After a set of unusual circumstances, he ate the Hito Hito no Mi (Human Human Fruit), which permitted him the ability to speak, think, and, to a limited extent, change into a human. Chopper often acts like a child, but he is an upright friend and companion who will try anything to overcome a task given by his team. He also still has distrust in humankind because of events in his youth, where he was treated as a brutal monster. He will often outright insult a human who compliments him while smiling, dancing, and being obviously pleased. He also shows a certain interest in books, but mostly medicine related ones. Chopper is more or less on a journey to define himself, seeing almost anybody on his crew as a role model. This, combined with his naiveness, often causes him to imitate the other Straw Hats' actions, no matter how obviously silly. Because of this, he often gets involved in the crazy antics of Luffy and Usopp, wholeheartedly believing that what they are doing is sensible and fun. Chopper is one of the most innocent Straw Hat Pirates, and is also very naive, resulting in a tendency to believe anything told to him, even the outrageously fictitious and exaggerated lies of Usopp. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper and continues to refer to him as ""the emergency food supply"" to tease him but considers him a friend. Although he is the crew's doctor he wasn't originally hired by Luffy for that purpose. But actually, in Luffy's words, for being ""cool reindeer that can transform."""
723,Nami,ナミ,Nami,https://myanimelist.net/character/723/Nami,"[{""name"": ""Age"", ""value"": ""18→20""}, {""name"": ""Birthdate"", ""value"": ""July 3, Cancer""}, {""name"": ""Height"", ""value"": ""169 cm (5' 6½\"") → 170 cm (5' 7\"")""}, {""name"": ""Sizes"", ""value"": ""95-55-85 → 98-58-88""}, {""name"": ""Affiliation"", ""value"": ""Straw Hat Pirates; Arlong Pirates (former)""}, {""name"": ""Position"", ""value"": ""Navigator""}, {""name"": ""Devil fruit"", ""value"": ""none""}, {""name"": ""Bounty"", ""value"": ""366,000,000 (previously: 16,000,000 and 66,000,000)""}]","She is the first member of the Straw Hat Pirates to appear (in the anime), but the third to align herself with the crew, and the fifth to actually join. Possibly one of the best (or even the best) navigators currently sailing the Grand Line, she has the ability to recognize and analyze even the slightest changes in the weather through sheer intuition, thus saving the ship and the crew from the very unstable Grand Line weather on multiple occasions. Nami has a tattoo on her left shoulder (a homage to her past), where she used to have a shark tattoo for being a member of Arlong's Crew. The new tattoo represents mikan (a fruit commonly know as tangerine) and pinwheels. She respects Luffy's qualities as a leader, but often gets angry of his irrational thinking and short attention span, even so she trusts him with her life. Despite the fact that Nami has deceived the crew, Luffy still trusts her enough to allow her to safe-keep his precious straw hat. She is almost always the one who gives orders on the ship (much to the Zoro's resentment) because of Luffy's usual lack of common sense. She often comically beats or hits her other crewmates for their nonsense, which occurs quite often. Robin is actually the only person Nami doesn't try to boss, and she referred to her as the only person who understands her, though in a comical fashion. She is very manipulative as well and can even turn an entire conversation in her favor when necessary, often putting on disguises and tricking the enemy. Acting as the ""mother"" of the crew, Nami doesn't understand or approve of the boys' often macho attitudes and principles. These are the only situations where Nami doesn't get the final word. Nami's two favorite things are money and tangerines. She is greedy and will do anything, aside from abandoning or killing her friends, for money. Due to her past - After having gathered money for 8 years (and even before that often stole things), Nami is naturally accustomed to it, but thinks of her friends as more important. She is very manipulative, and often takes advantage of Sanji for his devotion to her and Usopp to maintain her weapons. Roronoa Zoro tries not to fall for her schemes, but ends up a victim like the rest, usually due to debt and blackmail. Nami also tries to avoid fights, and is one of the less adventurous and brave members of the crew. However, since the invention of her Clima Tact (A weapon that forms weather patterns), she is now seen fighting her own battles instead of becoming the 'easy target,' as she doesn't want to be the one being saved anymore."
724,Usopp,ウソップ,Usopp,https://myanimelist.net/character/724/Usopp,"[{""name"": ""Age"", ""value"": ""17, 19""}, {""name"": ""Birthdate"", ""value"": ""April 1, Aries""}, {""name"": ""Height"", ""value"": ""174 cm (5'8½\"")""}, {""name"": ""Affiliation"", ""value"": ""Straw Hat Pirates; Usopp Pirates (former)""}, {""name"": ""Position"", ""value"": ""Sniper""}, {""name"": ""Devil Fruit"", ""value"": ""none""}, {""name"": ""Bounty"", ""value"": ""500,000,000 (previously: 200,000,000)""}, {""name"": ""Likes"", ""value"": ""Being seen as a hero, the Going Merry, Adventure""}, {""name"": ""Dislikes"", ""value"": ""Failure""}]","Usopp is a liar and likes to play pranks on his crew members or just goof off with Luffy and Chopper. He loves to tell tall tales to Chopper (who believes him blindly) or anyone who's listening. The other aspect of Usopp besides his lying is his cowardice; he is a very timid person, or so he thinks. In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle (except as his alter ego, Sogeking), he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything. He sometimes sees a role model in Zoro who never seems afraid but always proud. Usopp lacks a bit of self esteem and is often taken advantage of by Nami to make her weapons or repair and improve them - something he is very adept at, having constructed the ingenious weapon ""Clima Tact."" Usopp will also stand up and fight for not only the well-being of people, but also for their ideals - and the ideals of a pirate, which he holds very high. In battle he normally tries to trick his enemy by telling tales or mischievous lies to deceive them. Despite his lack of physical strength compared to other members of the crew, Usopp seems to be just as resilient as his comrades and this ability to bear loads and loads of damage, is one of his best traits, in addition to his cunning and intelligence, which has saved the Straw Hats on many occasions. Also, Usopp has outstanding marksmanship abilities with his slingshot and is on his way to becoming one of the best snipers in the One Piece world, although his goal in life is to become a proud and strong pirate like his father Yasopp of the Red Haired Pirate Crew."

He has since become a highly recurring character in the series. He accidentally consumed the Bara Bara no Mi, (Chop Chop fruit) a Devil Fruit, which allows him to separate his body parts and control them independent of each other, but robbed him of the ability to swim. The abilities gained from this fruit also make Buggy immune to attacks from knives or swords; any such attack just separates him into his component parts. In addition, most of his body is capable of flying through the air, fast enough to propel a man through a wall—with the crucial exception of his feet. However, even though the parts are separate, Buggy can still feel what the part feels (for example, when Luffy attacked Buggy, he separated his torso from his waist, only to find that Luffy was aiming for the crotch. Needless to say this left him with a rather painful result. Also when Buggy launched his hand out to pin down Zoro for Cabaji's Sting of the Unicycle Technique, Luffy stomped on it, inflicting tremendous pain). He also seems to require either a fixed distance from his detachments, or keep them within his line of vision, in order to manipulate them separately. Besides his Devil fruit abilities, he usually fights with three knives between his fingers. During the flashbacks of his youth, he already used these three knives. He also has a blade hidden in his shoe, and in Logue Town, he used a sword in his failed attempt to execute Luffy. Marineford Arc: Buggy's influence grew exponentially during the Impel Down Arc after he freed hundreds of powerful prisoners from Impel Down whose individual bounties are much higher than his own. After it was revealed that Buggy was once a member of the Roger Pirates, these prisoners came to heavily respect him and follow him wherever he went. Buggy's newfound authority created by his association with the Roger Pirates even attracted the attention of the World Government, who offered him a Warlord position. Buggy used this position to run a mercenary business called Buggy's Delivery, where he had authority over a large number of powerful mercenaries including giants from Elbaf. Levely Arc: The Seven Warlords system has been dissolved, and Buggy is now an enemy of the World Government again. He can no longer operate outside the law as he pleases. Wano Arc: It is revealed that Buggy actually became one of the four emperors of the sea, alongside Blackbeard, Luffy, and Shanks. He starts an organization with two former warlords, Mihawk and Sir Crocodile, known as ""Cross Guild."" The Cross Guild put bounties to marine soldiers, and now, the navy have to be afraid of even civilians who could kill them."

It is revealed that Vivi is actually the princess of Alabasta, but infiltrated Baroque Works as Miss Wednesday to find the identity of the leader, who turns out to be the Shichibukai member Sir Crocodile. With help from the Straw Hat Crew, she was able to reveal the truth to her people, ending several uprisings and stopping battles that would have forever ruined the nation. Trivia The word ""Nefertari"" in Vivi and her father's names is ancient Egyptian, and means ""the most beautiful"" or ""most wonderful"". It was a word often used to describe Egyptian queens and princesses. Oda admitted the Alabasta arc was based around ancient Egypt, but apparently had no clue on what the word meant when he chose the name. Despite her long absence from the series and her separation from ties to the Straw Hat crew, Vivi was featured on the cover page of chapters 271, 423 and 484, usually reserved to Straw Hats. That makes her the only non-Straw Hat other than the Going Merry to appear on a cover page. In the English manga and anime, her name is romanized as ""Nefeltari Vivi"". (Source: Wikipedia)"

Furthermore, he is Monkey D. Luffy's childhood hero and a former member of Gol D. Roger's Crew. Overall, he is greatly respected by most of the characters, despite having a ""soft"" and friendly nature and never appearing in actual combat until he started a fight with Whitebeard. As a whole, he does not make many appearances in the series, although he appears in a majority of the opening or closing themes of the anime. Shanks always wears a long black cape over his shoulders and until he met Luffy, wore a straw hat that he had worn for many years beforehand. He always wears trousers that are cut below the knee as well as a pair of sandals. The most striking thing about Shanks is the color of his red hair, of which his nick-name ""Red Haired Shanks"" comes from. He also has three scars across his left eye, which were given to him by Blackbeard a long time ago. He has a missing left arm, that he had lost when he saved Luffy from a Sea King. Shanks and his crew are almost always seen partying and drinking alcoholic beverages whenever they make an appearance as the Captain's favorite pastimes are attending and hosting parties and banquets. According to Oda, Shanks is the one character that resembles himself the most out of all the One Piece characters, because of his fun-loving partying nature."

He believes that he is a divine and immortal being, with the authority to do, take or destroy whatever he pleases. As the result, he appears fearless, childish, and without a care in the world. His lifestyle is relaxed and hedonistic, and when not attending to his godly duties of smiting the natives of Skypeia, he spends his time sleeping or eating (Enel's favourite fruit is apples) in his residence, being waited on hand and foot by beautiful women. This attitude carries over to his battles, where he's hardly serious and barely annoyed - instead he's relaxed, and enjoys himself by effortlessly absorbing attacks, and humiliating his opponents. In his fight against Kamakiri, he even went to sleep in the middle of the fight, in order to prove his immortality. Enel holds no regard for other's lives except his own, and has no moral qualms about killing thousands- instead he sees it as his godly duty, and laughs as he sends Skypeia to its doom. He is in short completely insane, which was more or less undeniable when he sets off for the moon, which he believes to be the home of God (himself). Before Luffy showed up, his fruit power and mantra ability made his God complex completely legitimate. Once Luffy began gaining the upper hand in the battle he incapacitated him, in order to remove him as a threat, and reclaim his status as ""invincible"" - and from this point acts somewhat cowardly, trying his best to avoid another confrontation with Luffy. Enel appears to posses a vast knowledge of mechanics and technology, as well. He personally designed his flying ark, Maxim, and knows its inner workings inside and out; if any damage is done to the inside, he is able to repair it (assuming it's repairable). He was even able to design a stormcloud production system (known as Deathpiea), an electrical power system, and a Jet Dial failsafe for the ark, in the event that the main engines are damaged."

Because of his status and power, defeating him is Roronoa Zoro's ultimate goal. Mihawk is so strong, in fact, he is accused by some characters (and fans) of having the power of a Devil Fruit; however, nothing has stated anything but that his abilities simply come from pure skill and power. He wields the Black Sword Yoru, the strongest sword in the world. It's an ornately decorated, man-sized (6 feet) sword shaped like a cross with a shiny black blade, curved at the end. It also seems to generate otherworldly purple streaks as it slices, as seen when he cut down Zoro and when he split Don Krieg's ship in half. He can tear pirate ships apart with a single, unseen slash of his sword, blocking bullets with a simple turn of his sword, and he can easily defend against even legendary swords with a small, inch-long knife concealed in the cross he wears around his neck. In appearance, Mihawk wears very decorative, ornate, black-and-red clothing. His most identifiable clothing would be his wide-rimmed hat adorned with a large piece of fluff, a long, black cloak, and his cross necklace and sword. He is easily compared to the real-life pirate Bartholomew Roberts, AKA Black Bart, who also donned a crimson overcoat, a wide brimmed hat with a red feather, and a diamond cross attached to a gold chain around his neck. Mihawk travels around in a coffin-shaped raft with two green-flamed candles, a single black sail, and a single seat. The fact that he can traverse across the unforgiving oceans, as well as the Grand Line itself, in such a meager craft is yet another testament to his abilities. (Source: Wikipedia)"
2072,Ace Portgas D.,ポートガス・D・エース,"Portgas D., Ace",https://myanimelist.net/character/2072/Ace_Portgas_D,,"One of the most obvious features on Ace is his tattoos. Ace's back tattoo is left intact in the English version of the dub despite 4Kids' previous edits to crosses. At the same time Ace also promotes his tattoo to Luffy, something which is truly considered odd by 4Kids standards. Ace has a tattoo on his back of the Whitebeard symbol; a skull with a white mustache and a manji behind it. To avoid confusion between the two symbols and avoid slander for being a nazi, this was changed to crossbones in the shape of a ""cross"" in the anime, as well as in the most recent chapter of the manga. Ace has another tattoo on his left arm by the shoulder: it reads ""ASCE"" with the ""S"" (apparently a mistake on the part of the tattoo artist, or, alternatively, the symbol that appeared on the flag of his old crew  though it may also serves as a symbol of his other deceased sworn brother Sabo crossed out. In the English version of the anime, Ace's shoulder tattoo signifying his name is edited out, as he is referred to there as ""Portgaz D. Trace."" He appears in One Piece Grand Adventure, once again without the tattoo on his arm. Ace travels around the Grand Line on his boat which is constructed so his Mera Mera no Mi fuels the engine on the rear end allowing it to move. Currently, Ace is one of the two known pirates to ever escape arrest by the Marine captain Smoker, the other escapee being Ace's younger brother Luffy. Ace and Smoker fought to a standstill in Alabasta. He left Fuusha Village three years before Luffy, and he is a loyal crewman and commands the Second Division of Whitebeard, his captain. In appearance, the two brothers are obviously related, despite the fact that Ace is more muscular than the rather lanky Luffy. He also sports rather childish freckles. He is apparently narcoleptic (a trait common amongst Ace's family) and therefore falls asleep on random occasions, making people wonder if he has dropped dead. As far as personality goes, Ace is much more intelligent, polite, and generally more bearable than his younger brother, which prompts the Straw Hat crew to question whether he is truly related to their bumbling captain. However, the brothers themselves are very close, Ace portraying typical good-big-brother behaviors such as asking the crew to keep an eye on his little brother. It is revealed that Ace had a bounty of 550,000,000 in the One Piece Ten exhibition. It is later revealed that Ace is not biologically related to Luffy at all, but is in fact the son of Gol D. Roger and Portgas D. Rouge. Ace took his mothers surname as a thanks for trading her own life while giving birth to him. Ace also hates his father for ""abandoning"" his mother. (Source: Wikipedia)"

He is known as ""Kuro of the Thousand Plans"" for his elaborate plans that virtually never fail. Thusly, he earns the title of the second most intelligent person in the East Blue behind Ben Beckman.  He has super-human speed with which to deliver his attacks. His skill is such that at full speed he is only able to be seen as a vague blur or by the damage his attacks cause. He primarily uses a special attack called Shakushi (Death Scoop/Death Ladle), that allows him to sweep a large area, killing anything his claws connect with at random, including his own crew. The technique travels roughly the same speed as CP9's Soru ability. The difference is that when Kuro uses that technique, he cannot see what he is attacking, whereas CP9 have mastered this ability and therefore can. (Source: Wikipedia)"

Bellamy earned his nickname from his trademark grin and his reputation for scavenging riches from other pirates, much like a hyena scavenges its food. Bellamy's character is one that is arrogant, violent and vain, but significantly humbled when facing more powerful foes, as he revealed to Donquixote Doflamingo that he only engages in fights that he knows he can win. This later led to his defeat by Monkey D. Luffy, whom Bellamy thought was weak. Bellamy and his pirate crew play a significant role in the Jaya Arc of the series. After the end of the Skypiea arc, the true leader of the Bellamy Pirates, Donquixote Doflamingo travels to Jaya to kick Bellamy out of his crew and forces Sarquiss to attack and apparently kill him ""as a lesson,"" for disgracing his flag.

He believes it will reveal the location of the weapon Pluton, which Crocodile wishes to gain control of in order to establish his military power. He is defeated by Monkey D. Luffy and stripped of his Shichibukai status by the World Government, after which he is imprisoned. Crocodile ate the fictional Devil Fruit Suna Suna no Mi (Sand Sand Fruit, スナスナの実), giving him the ability to control sand, as well as avoid damage by turning into sand.

She is also very well-versed in the famous katana of One Piece, knowing their names and origins. Tashigi wields Shigure, a Wazamono sword. Tashigi's stated goal is to remove all Meitō ,named swords with prestigious histories, from the hands of those who would use them for their own ends.

He is said to be the pirate closest to obtaining the legendary treasure, One Piece. It is said that Whitebeard used to have numerous battles with the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, and was marked as his equal in the past. Whitebeard appears to have some health problems, possibly stemming from his advanced age or from his ferocious encounters with other great pirates during his earlier days. He is always surrounded by nurses and is hooked up to intravenous tubes. But despite this, he still drinks rum by (and directly from) the barrel. Even with his health issues, he is still considered the world's strongest pirate, which raises the question of how powerful he must have been in his prime. When he first appears, he receives a letter from Red-Haired Shanks on behalf of Shanks' newest crewmate Rockstar. However, before even reading the letter, Whitebeard throws it away, claiming that if Shanks wants to talk, then he should visit in person. He even asks Rockstar to tell Shanks to prepare an expensive bottle of sake when Shanks comes to visit. When Shanks finally breaks through a blockade for their meeting, he calls him ""boy"", showing his feelings for the much younger captain, compared to his own age and prestige in the ""New World"" section of the Grand Line.

2752,Kuzan,クザン,Kuzan,https://myanimelist.net/character/2752/Kuzan,,"Kuzan, better known by his former alias Aokiji, was one of the three Marine admirals. He was nominated by Sengoku for the position of fleet admiral. However, after losing the position to Akainu, he resigned from the Marines. Kuzan is a very laid back man, showing no shock or surprise from almost anything. His lack of interest and lazy justice (as he describes his motto himself) let others often believe he can not possibly be a marine of such a high ranking. However, if he deems a situation worthy, he will take action, as shown when he created a passage to another island for a few injured castaways at Long Ring Long Land. He seems to be the kindest of the three admirals, helping Tonjit at Long Ring Land to cross the ocean with the power of his Devil Fruit and even letting Nico Robin escape the Buster Call on Ohara. He seems to dislike the Shichibukai, or at least Crocodile; he said that the only reason he did not kill Luffy was that Luffy had defeated Crocodile. In contrast to his fellow admiral Sakazuki, Kuzan has a sense of honour, as he keeps his word to not attack the Straw Hats after accepting a one-on-one fight with Luffy. Kuzan's moral stance is unknown, but it is likely that he follows Moral Justice. He is disgusted by Sakazuki's brutal actions in dealing with situations (such as the Ohara Incident), calling him a fool. While he may follow Moral Justice, he does understand the position his ranking puts him in, as he does not hesitate to do what is necessary for the needs of the Marines, as shown when he freezes Jaguar D. Saul after the Ohara incident, and attacked Luffy and Whitebeard during the Marineford War. Aokiji was a faithful follower of the World Government. He always tried to obey orders but sometimes found his own ideals in opposition to his orders. Even as he followed his orders, he would sometimes exhibit a sense of mercy and honor that other World Government officials did not. Like many characters in One Piece (for example, Jaguar D. Saul and Smoker), after witnessing the senseless murder of many innocent people, Aokiji may have come to realise how low these events have sunk the World Government. His relaxed demeanour while performing the more macabre of his duties is similar to that of Borsalino, making him one of the more complicated characters in the series. Despite not really wanting the position of fleet admiral, he was even more opposed to Sakazuki getting the position, and fought his fellow admiral rather than letting him take it. After being defeated, Kuzan chose to resign from the Marines rather than stay under Akainu's command."

In reference to his animal theme, the flamingo, his clothes are brightly colored with his feathered coat being distinctively pink. He also has an odd way of walking, a bow-legged waddle (but does not always do this), which is also a reference to his animal theme. Twenty-two years ago, his hair was longer than currently, had two earrings in his left ear, and he sported a pair of goggles that he wore on his forehead, in addition to his sunglasses that he wears to this day. He has a white shirt with red stripes, a green belt, and orange pants with white stripes. Originally in the anime, Doflamingo had a red shirt with black stripes, a purple belt, and black pants with red stripes. However, when he reappeared during the events of Sabaody, his color scheme was switched to its manga depiction with the exception of his glasses. In the manga, he has orange tinted glasses while in the anime, he has purple tinted ones. He is also often, if not always, smiling. Doflamingo is one of the most carefree characters in One Piece. He seems to have a penchant for dramatic phrasing, as well as a habit of exaggerated posing when giving declarations. He also appears to fear nothing and no one, as he openly taunts Fleet Admiral Sengoku, sits on the table during the Shichibukai meeting and shows only gleeful interest at the thought of warring with Whitebeard. During the Battle of Marineford, all of Doflamingo's interactions have all been for the sake of personal amusement, hinting a sadistic side. He also has an odd habit of sitting in odd positions, like on the back of chairs, on tables, barrels and, even a pile of bodies in the middle of a war zone. Although Doflamingo appeared in the first half of the series frequently, he did not play much of a role until the second half. He is the main antagonist of the Dressrosa Arc and one of the central antagonists of the Pirate Alliance Saga.

This time came when Blackbeard murdered a member of the Whitebeard Pirates, thus prompting his departure from the crew, and Ace's hunt for him. Blackbeard was also the one who gave Shanks the scars around his eye, a long time ago. Shanks also tells Whitebeard to call back Ace on his hunt for Blackbeard, as he was concerned about the timing of a confrontation between Ace and Blackbeard. After Luffy defeated Crocodile in Alabasta, Lafitte tried to nominate Blackbeard to become one of the Shichibukai to take Crocodile's place, but in order to be accepted, Blackbeard must first build up a fearsome reputation. Blackbeard happened to be in Jaya, at the same time Luffy was. Both Luffy and Blackbeard seem to strike up a rivalry when they nearly got into a fight over how they like or dislike one of the island tavern's food. However, not long after that he'd given Luffy a friendly speech about how pirates will never stop dreaming. Despite their similarities (and comical contrasts), it was revealed in the Jaya arc that Blackbeard was looking to take out a strong pirate to make a name for himself - and he chose Luffy after learning of his 100 million Belli bounty at the time.

He seems to honor the samurai honor code very heavily as he comically attempts to take his own life after dishonoring himself. As he accepts the blame for nearly anything, even faults of others, this happens quite often in his appearances. Before he commits seppuku, however, he instinctively uses tekkai every time, unintentionally saving his own life. He seems to have strong feelings for his deceased mother, beginning to sob, even while fighting, at the very thought of her. He claims her ""divine protection"" is the reason for his failed suicide-attempts. These dramatic statements are somewhat undercut by Oda's revelation that his mother is in fact alive, and working as an assassin. [3] He claims to dislike lies, though he seems to have no trouble with melodramatic stories. Kumadori is a sennin (仙人, a type of hermit in Japanese mythology who can control even their body's autonomic functions, as well as live forever, similar to fellow Shonen Jump character Jiraiya of the popular series Naruto), which explains his sudden weight gain/loss as well as the ability to control his hair. Kumadori is a very loud character, and utters very few sentences not written in bolded fonts and ending with exclamation marks. He has the strange habit of yelling something resembling ""YOYOI!!"" rather often. He tends to repeat or draw out syllables and words in the manner of kabuki actors. Kumadori's name most likely comes from the Japanese word kumadori (隈取り, a type of makeup used for kabuki), as his features look very similar to those of kabuki actors in their makeup. His body positions (especially his penchant for holding one hand out in front of him) are also reminiscent of mie poses, and his vocal inflection is similar to that of kabuki actors. His fighting abilities seem to revolve around controlling his hair, using it to grab his enemies and attacking them. He also has a shakujō that he occasionally uses in battle. He also has a penchant for spouting off haiku when fighting. Kumadori was originally fighting with Nami, who was at a severe disadvantage. However, Chopper appeared and helped Nami (after Nami had already stolen Kumadori's key) to escape, becoming Kumadori's opponent. Despite Kumadori's advantage of being a sennin, Chopper consumed a third Rumble Ball, and his subsequent ""Monster Point"" form severely injured Kumadori and threw him all the way back to the courthouse."

Mr. 2 Bon Clay is the only Officer Agent in Baroque Works without a female partner. This stems from the belief that, as an okama, he fills both roles by himself. Likewise, his name is a composite of a male Baroque Works agent's number and a female agent's holiday-based name. ""Bon Clay"" is celebrated in Japan on either July 15 or August 15 because of the use of a lunar calendar. It is a Buddhist celebration found on the last day of the Bon festival, honoring the dead.

He only ate the cap and the trunk of the mushroom still resides on his chin. (Source: Wikipedia)"
4887,Arlong,アーロン,Arlong,https://myanimelist.net/character/4887/Arlong,,"Arlong the Saw is a sawshark fishman. He was the pirate captain of the all fishman crew, the Arlong Pirates, a former member of the Sun Pirates, and the older brother of Madam Shyarly. He is known for being the main villain in the Arlong Arc and had the highest bounty in East Blue before being defeated by Monkey D. Luffy. Like many other One Piece characters, he has his own unique laugh, which is ""Shahahahaha"". Arlong considers humans to be inferior beings and is very cruel to them. He is keen to separate his race from humans, and is constantly stuck by this mentality that his people are superior to humans in every way. He thinks nothing of killing a town full of humans, although he seems to prefer controlling people with money and deals (like Nami and Nezumi.) He has an eye for spotting exploitable talent that he can use for his goals and is an excellent planner. He spent eight years using Nami and her maps to plan his takeover of the East Blue. Nevertheless, any promise about money he makes, he keeps. The best example is when his crew urged him to keep Nami even if she brings the 100,000,000 Beli. However, even though Arlong states he can't go back on his word, he has no qualms about exploiting loopholes in his deals to unfairly get his way. He is rather easy to anger, going berserk after he was attacked by Usopp and having to be dragged back to his base by his crew to prevent him from destroying the whole town. During his fight with Luffy, the boy's constant fighting back made Arlong mad, to the point where it drove him into a deep anger.Arlong himself had expected Luffy to die quickly, but his anger made him become reckless and destructive, even seriously damaging his own HQ building while attacking Luffy. He has been ill-tempered since his younger years. However, he wasn't always entirely brutal. During a battle with the Marines, Arlong told Jinbe to leave the unconscious Marines alone. However, it was later shown that he had grown more arrogant over time to the point that he completely had no sympathy for humans. Tiger's death led to his hatred hitting rock bottom. He also failed to understand Fisher Tiger's reason for letting humans that they attacked live. As a result, when Arlong led his own crew and had committed murder, humans came to view him as a ""monster"". He was loathed for the actions of him and his crew. In the end, he enslaved humans just as the humans once enslaved many fishmen. Though his opinions and his ideals were extreme, he displayed a high level of brotherhood with his crew and even towards Nami despite her species divide. Arlong looked after his crew members and even though he betrayed Nami, he did so because he didn't want to lose her talent. On top of this, in the final moments of the battle with Luffy, he stated that Nami was his crew member and would be forever, and while he never displayed any regard for her as a friend he was prepared to fight to keep her in the crew. If humans insulted their group, Arlong would react to the insult, and due to the high level of concern amongst his officers they would attempt to keep his temper under control. When weaker members of his crew were hurt, Arlong would seek out revenge on those who had committed the act against those crew members. Ironically, Arlong is a hypocrite, having accused Koala of being raised to look down on fishmen and think of humans as better than everyone else, when Arlong looked down on humans and preached fishmen superiority himself, making him no better than the humans. Surprisingly despite his hatred of humanity according to Hatchan, Arlong would never harm his fellow fishmen no matter the circumstance. He cared for his crew to a level that when Luffy used one of them as a shield, Arlong became extremely angry."

Her right arm is covered in tattoos, which she got to help Nami not to feel ashamed of her tattoo of Arlong's pirate logo. After trying to stop Nami from attacking Captain Nezumi, a Naval officer who tries to take the money Nami raised for her deal with Arlong, Nojiko was shot by him in the back. However, she survived.

Hatchan is not very bright but a skilled swordsman, using rokutōryū (""six sword style""). He fights with Zoro during the Arlong arc. Despite Zoro suffering a fever and severe blood loss from his unhealed wounds (which he got eariler fighting Mihawk), Hatchan is still defeated by him. Outside of battle, he is extremely helpful and friendly (though it should be noted that he can be just as cruel to humans as the other crew members are), addressing Zoro politely when they first met, and giving him a ride of a bay on his back. Later in the manga (in a title page arc that was never animated), Hatchan goes on many adventures, meeting a mermaid, that ends with him opening a floating takoyaki restaurant. In Hatchan's Sea-Floor Stroll, it's revealed that Hatchan, along with Chu and Kuroobi, planned to open a takoyaki store when they were younger. His nickname Hachi could also mean eight in Japanese, a reference to him being an octopus fish-man. Hatchan's name is quite strange. In the Japanese language, chan is a diminutive suffix, added to the end of someone's name, giving it the meaning of ""cute"" or ""little"". However, Hatchan insists that his name is Hatchan and that Hachi is just a nickname. When questioned on this, Oda replied that the chan is the same as the last name of ""Chan"" common in Chinese, rather than the suffix -chan. (Source: Wikipedia)"

When Arlong arrives at her island, Bellemere is the only person to fight back with any degree of success.

He ends just about all his sentences with ""smek"". (""chew"" in the 4kids dub) He later fights with the apparently-outmatched Usopp, but he is ultimately beaten after Usopp wears him down by running away and setting him on fire, before repeatedly hitting him over his head with his ""Usopp-Hammer"" to knock him out.

He is like a father figure to Nami and Nojiko since they were kids and he knew their adoptive mother, Bellemere, quite well. He also kept the town together after Arlong took over the island, making sure everyone was safe and able to pay their tax. Genzo wears a pinwheel on his hat because he used it to make Nami laugh when she was a baby (this pinwheel also inspired an attack for Luffy during their fight with Arlong). He played a role in rescuing Luffy after Arlong threw him into the ocean. All of Genzo's scars are from his first encounter with Arlong when he tried to stop him from taking Nami, Arlong made Kuroobi cut every part of his body with a sword. He was also almost killed by Arlong for hoarding novelty swords, until Usopp saved him. Genzo's pinwheel inspired Nami's new tattoo--a pinwheel to represent him with a tangerine to represent Bellemere. After Nami sails off with Luffy and crew, Genzo says he no longer needs his pinwheel, placing it by Bellemere's grave. The origin of the pinwheel is then revealed. Bell-Mere said that Nami cried when she saw Genzo because he looked scary, but then Genzo put his pinwheel on to make Nami laugh. It is revealed later in the manga that Luffy is very interested in the pinwheel {this inspires a new attack for Luffy, Gomu Gomu No Pinwheel}, not even noticing the Navy who are trying to find Nami, just Genzo's pinwheel. However, this could be a put down in reference to Luffy's simple-mindedness. He threatens Luffy that if he finds out that he made Nami cry, he'll come after him. However, Luffy lived up to that promise, as Nami's sister, Nojiko pointed out. Genzo appears again later, and is outraged by Nami's wanted poster, wherein she is in a bikini, saying she'll get more suitors than bounty hunters, yet has blown it up poster-sized hanging in his house.

After they're both brought on board, Yosaku's bout of scurvy is cured, and they stay on the Going Merry for a while (since their boat was destroyed in the cannon blast). They tag along with the Straw Hats throughout the ""Don Krieg"" & ""Arlong Park"" arcs, after which they decide to remain behind at Cocoyashi village to help out the villagers.

Quite pompous and at times silly, Mohji has the ability to control any animal he wishes, or so he says. He has yet to prove it in the series outside of his pet, a lion named Richie, who is more like another crew member than just a pet. Mohji usually opts to use him in battle rather than fight himself. He is, however, fast and agile, and very skilled with a whip. He is also responsible for burning things, such as the pet-food shop and the Going Merry. In his first appearance, Mohji was sent by Buggy to capture Roronoa Zoro. However, Monkey D. Luffy got in his way, who eventually defeated Mohji after he burned down a pet-food shop that belonged to a recently deceased man and his still-living dog. After Buggy's defeat Mohji and Cabaji fought over leadership of the group. They were equally matched, and fought for several hours. The battle ended when a sleep-walking Richie knocked them both unconscious, taking over leadership himself. However, Richie and the pirates were kidnapped by a cannibalistic group, but saved by Buggy, Alvida, Mohji, and Cabaji. Mohji later participated in the attack on Loguetown. It was his job to burn down the Straw-Hat's boat, which he failed to do as soon as it started to rain. Nami and Usopp found him and Richie, but as soon as Mohji sent Richie to attack, Usopp used an egg to distract the lion. The Marines showed up, and started shooting at everyone. Mohji was able to dodge the bullets and flee the scene with the rest of Buggy's group. Much later, Mohji reappeared with the group as they travel in the Grand Line and find a mysterious man named Portgas D. Ace. He was also in the TV Special that featured the One Piece characters as ninjas, and appeared in several video games. Every time Mohji appears in the series for an arc, his hairstyle changes.

But once Cabaji is knocked off his unicycle, he is easily defeated by Zoro's 'Oni Giri' which cuts open his chest. After Buggy's crew was defeated by Luffy, he fought with the 'other' first mate Mohji for the title for the next captain--both were knocked out by a sleepwalking Richie, who gained the title (though lost it just as quick).

Since his species travels in pods, he had forged a powerful bond of friendship with these pirates, and he patiently waited for them at Grand Line's entrance. His caretaker is a doctor named Crocus, who normally mans the Lighthouse that introduces travelers into Grand Line. Crocus revealed to the Straw Hat Pirates that Laboon's friends effectively abandoned him by fleeing the Grand Line through the Calm Belt. (although this may not be true as Brook described his crew as being slaughtered in the Florian Triangle) The pirates were recently revealed to be the crew of Brook the skeleton, leaving him as Laboon's only crewmate left. The old doctor has cared for Laboon ever since his friends left him. Although Laboon knows the truth about his friends, he refuses to admit to himself that they are gone. Laboon has many scars on his head from slamming into Reverse Mountain, for he believes he can destroy the mountain and return to West Blue. Monkey D. Luffy, in an effort to give Laboon a renewed sense of hope, picks a fight with the whale by jamming the Going Merry's mast into his head. After the battle (which Luffy calls a draw), Luffy promises to Laboon that he will return to see him, under the guise of wanting a rematch. As a sign of this, Luffy paints the Strawhat Jolly Roger on Laboon's head, commenting that the insignia will wash away if Laboon hits Reverse Mountain further. The Straw hats depart, leaving behind two important friends. Recently, the only known survivor of the pirates that had abandoned him fifty years ago has been revealed to be Brook, an undead skeleton the Straw Hats met shortly before they arrived on Thriller Bark.

Not much is known about Hattori, the pigeon that is constantly seen perched on Lucci's shoulder. It appears to have no special significance. While acting as Lucci's voice Hattori expresses human body language, matching the behavior of a professional shipwright: constantly insulting and lecturing Paulie because of his reckless lifestyle. Hattori seems to have affection for his emotionless and bloodthirsty master, as seen when he flew to Lucci's unconscious body. He also seems to leave his master when he enters any sort of battle, returning directly afterwards. Hattori's name presumably comes from combining the Japanese word for pigeon, hato (鳩) with the word for bird, tori (鳥). Lucci is later revealed to be a member of CP9, more properly known as Cipher Pol Number 9, and one of the main antagonists of the Water 7 and Enies Lobby Arcs. Lucci comes off as a cold and collected CP9 agent, almost never displaying any emotions. In spite of his seeming lack of emotions, he does not like being insulted. During his fight with Luffy he did not pay attention to Usopp, until he started to insult him. An example is the brutal assault on his friend of five years, Paulie, whom he even tried to kill after the CP9's identities had been revealed. He also states that he feels no true bond with the city he's lived in for five years, and he seems to have no feelings for his fellow CP9 colleagues, least of all Spandam. As the strongest member of CP9, Rob Lucci's great power is acknowledged even by the Shichibukai. Even at the tender age of thirteen, Lucci was already known to be a very capable mass-murderer, having killed 500 soldiers and a crew of pirates single-handedly. It should be also noted that Rob Lucci is the strongest member of CP9 in history by far. Lucci ate the Neko-Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard, a Zoan-class Devil Fruit which allows him to transform into a leopard and a giant leopard-human hybrid. (Source: One Piece Wikia)"
5750,Iceburg,アイスバーグ,Iceburg,https://myanimelist.net/character/5750/Iceburg,,"The president of the Galley-La company, Iceburg is currently 38 years old. He is loved by the people of Water 7, especially by all of his workers. They enjoy his company and often ask for his opinion and input on anything having to do with building ships. Iceburg at times seems to have two different personalities. Sometimes, he acts in a very childish way, canceling all of his meetings so that he can show people around, refusing to meet with people because he doesn't like them, finding animals on the ground and taking care of them, and other such behaviors. He currently has a mouse that he named ""Tyrannosaurus"". However, when the time comes, he can be very serious, and it becomes clear that his childishness is only when he is relaxed. Iceburg was the holder of the plans to Pluton for four years after Tom's death. After those four years, he secretly gave them to Franky, Tom's other apprentice that Iceburg had known since the two were children. However, as this was done in secret, the government still believes that Iceburg is in possession of the plans. As such, some officials come to try and get them from him on a regular basis. Iceburg also believed that Nico Robin deserved death because she was the only person alive who could decipher the ancient Poneglyphs that could revive Pluton. He tries to kill her during the Water 7 arc, but later believes that he was wrong about her and that she is a good person. The recent Aqua Laguna and its devastating impact on Water 7 gave Iceburg the desire to make Water 7 into a boat and float it on the water. When talking to Franky, Iceburg gave out Tom's famous quote, ""With a DON!"". Franky agreed that the phrase suited Iceburg. * Iceburg was recently voted the 19th most popular character in One Piece. * According to a Volume 43 SBS, Iceburg's birthday is January 3rd. This is because ai is the pronunciation of the English letter ""i"", which looks like the number one. Su is the first part of the Japanese pronunciation of the word ""three"" (surī). Put together, these make Aisu (Ice), the first part of Iceburg's name. * Despite the fact that Eiichiro Oda has spelled his name as ""Iceburg"" multiple times, this isn't always used. Many fans prefer the name ""Iceberg"". The anime itself spelled the name as ""Icebarg"" once, while Oda himself wrote it as ""Iceberg"" in a recent fan poll. * Occasionally, he says “nmaa” before his sentences. It seems he uses it as an ancillary word to express his frustration; similar to the word “well”. (Source: Wikipedia)"

She also tends to notice things that others cannot, such as when she spotted Luffy wedged between two buildings (which is where he landed after Rob Lucci knocked him out of Galley-La Corporation Headquarters) or how she managed to find secret passageways in the Tower of Justice at Enies Lobby. She, along with Gonbe, later sneak aboard the prototype Sea Train, Rocketman, and accompany the Straw Hats, Franky Family, and Galley-La foremen to Enies Lobby. And later helped Luffy find the secret passageway that Spandam, Lucci and Robin took on the way to the Gate of Justice. As Kokoro is revealed to be a mermaid, it is possible that Chimney, being her granddaughter, may have latent mermaid abilities of her own. Although Chimney doesn't seem to have any mermaid characteristics, she was able to save Luffy, who is 3 times her size, from drowning off screen while resisting what must have been an overwhelming current from the several whirlpools in the sea in front of the Gate of Justice. Currently, she is in Water Seven. In the Volume 45 SBS, Oda revealed that Chimney is indeed 1/4 mermaid, and is thus an abnormally good swimmer. (Source: Wikipedia)"

He originated from Tibet and age is unknown. He is 200 cm (6'6"") tall, weighs 122kg (270 lbs), and has a Super Power Rating of 3,300,000. His mortal blow techniques: Bamboo Leaf Panda Drop and Giant Panda Deathlock. His Explanation: Abandoned in a bamboo thicket as an infant, Panda Man was raised by Giant Pandas. (all of these mentioned are not seen in the One Piece manga or Anime, and as such it should be taken with a grain of salt.) He is an Akuma Chōjin who resolved to become strong because when he told people he had seen Kaguya-Hime, they didn't believe him and picked on him. (Kaguyahime was a princess who was found inside a bamboo stump, according to Japanese legends.) According to Oda, Pandaman is a rich guy living on a certain island.[9] He is often seen in the same panel as one of the Tomato Gang, a debt collector on the lookout for Pandaman, trying to collect the money Pandaman owes (which is why Pandaman is often seen running away on appearances). Pandaman's bounty is revealed to be at least more than 3,333,333 beli during the Anime Filler Arc Ice Hunter on Episode 326, as Kanpaccino's hand blocks the entire number. (Source: Wikipedia)"

Because of the wait, he becomes impatient and starts showing his power, the ability of the Atsu Atsu no Mi (Atsu meaning heat.) which allows him to heat up his own body and thus things he touches.

Like Mihawk and Donquixote Doflamingo, he was present at the government summit of Mariejoa following Sir Crocodile's defeat in Alabasta. Comparing his height to Perona's in Chapter 473, he is well over twenty feet tall and is only matched in size by Moria's true body. According to Gecko Moria, Kuma is the only obedient Shichibukai of the World Government. Kuma seems to have the ability to teleport, which enables him to appear in the blink of an eye. Although the nature of Kuma's ability is unknown at this moment, he also shows the ability to make anyone he touches disappear to an unknown place, demonstrated when he makes Perona of the Thriller Bark crew disappear by touching her with his bare hand (she most likely went to the destination she said she wished to be). Also, Kuma asks Gecko Moria where he would like to travel to, further suggesting this ability. According to Perona, Kuma was known for his brutality as a pirate. However, his asking of where to ""teleport"" people reflects his change in personality. During a conformation of him and Gecko Moria, it was shown that the two are approximately equal in height, both being inhumanly tall. He also tends to use target metaphors (eg. ""We now have the same target"" and ""You're right on Target, I am Bartholomew Kuma""). Due to his apparently reserved disposition and the fact that he is invariably seen with a large bible, Kuma is likely modeled after Bartholomew ""Black Bart"" Roberts, a gentleman pirate known for his religious obstinacy. Currently, Bartholomew has met with fellow member Gecko Moria about the appointment of Marshall D. Teach as a new Shichibukai member as well as to offer his assistance on the defeat of the Straw Hat crew. Though he has not met with them, he does have knowledge regarding Luffy's brother, Portgas D. Ace. Recently, after reporting Moria's defeat, he was ordered to eliminate everyone on Thriller Bark and chooses Roronoa Zoro as his first target. Kuma had consumed the 'Nikyu Nikyu no Mi' (Paw Paw Fruit) which gives him paw-like prints on his palms and enables him to 'push' tangible materials like people and intangible objects like the air at the speed of light. Following the events in Sabody Archepelago, he appeared in Pacifista form, having been fully turned into a robot by the World Government scientist Vegapunk. After encountering the Straw Hats, who were struggling after defeating one of the Pacifistas immediately after an encounter with Kizaru, he defeats them and transports each one to a different island. He is once again present at the battle of Marineford, in Pacifista form, along with several mass-production models. It was revealed that Kuma only teleported the Straw hats in order to save them from being killed by Admiral Kizaru. It was also revealed that Kuma works for the Revolutionary Army and told Rayleigh that they have a connection with the Straw hats. (Source: Wikipedia)"
7454,Moriah Gekko,ゲッコー･モリア,"Gekko, Moriah",https://myanimelist.net/character/7454/Moriah_Gekko,,"Moria is the captain of the world's biggest pirate ship, Thriller Bark, and has a former bounty of 320,000,000 Beli. Moria apparently has the power to turn people's shadows (including his own) into solid objects due to the power of the Kage Kage no Mi (Shadow Shadow Fruit), but the full extent of his powers are yet unknown. He is the one who stole Brook's, and various other beings' shadows. The loss of a being's shadow causes them to go into a two day coma, and to be vaporized if they come in contact with sunlight. The shadow acts a second soul, duplicating its owner's movements and mannerisms. Moria creates zombies by inserting a shadow into a lifeless corpse. Coupled with physiologically enhanced bodies engineered by Hogback, he is able to create powerful and obedient zombie warriors. However, if the original owner of the shadow dies, the zombie created from that person's shadow will also die. As a result, Moria has the de-shadowed people placed on their ship and removed from Thriller Bark. He is an extremely large man and has a devil-like appearance, mainly due to his horns and shadowy figure. His size is equivalent to fellow Shichibukai member Bartholomew Kuma, but he creates smaller (but still impressively large) shadow clones to do his work. He wields a pair of gigantic scissors that he uses to cut the shadows of his victims from their bodies upon seizing them. He is a very calm person and is not even bothered by the fact that his ship and crew are being destroyed. He also has X like marks above his nose and below his chin that may be stitches. Moria's motto is to rely on others to reach his goals. His favorite phrase is: ""You do it!"", reflecting his slothful personality and tendency to leave all work for his underlings. This also expands to his fighting style, as he prefers to lay back and let his own shadow, Doppelman, who he can switch places with at any time, battle with the powers of the Kage Kage no Mi. Trivia * Like many other characters in One Piece, Moria has a strange laugh (kishishishi). * His name is a double-pun on his animal theme gecko and the Japanese word for 'Moonlight' (月光, 'Gekkou'), given his nightmare theme. * Like Luffy and a few other characters in One Piece (including fellow shichibukai Blackbeard and Crocodile), Gecko Moria wants to be the new Pirate King.

This is later exposed as a lie when the crew discovers that Hogback himself created the zombies, and is a crew mate of Gecko Moria, who breathes life into Hogback's zombies with the shadows he steals, transferring the fighting ability and personality of the shadow's former owner into the body. He is later seen meeting with Gecko Moria, Perona and Absalom concerning the creation of Zombie #900 and the removal of Luffy's shadow. Hogback faced off against Chopper, who, as a doctor, resents his experiments in zombification for being intended for personal gain rather than the progress of medical science. However, much to Chopper and Robin's dismay, Hogback had prepared Jigoro and Sanji's zombie for the battle to come. After Chopper and Robin being defeated, Hogback and Chopper have a conversation, where Hogback reveals that he never cared about saving lives and the reason he went into hiding was because so many people were coming to him seeking treatment, and that he became a doctor only for the money. Robin outsmarts him by telling him to order Jigoro and Penguin to jump out the window. After facing the betrayal of his beloved zombie version of Cindry, Chopper and Robin prepare to finish him off with a suplex wrestling attack, but the rampage by the massive Oz prevents them from finishing the attack. As Hogback tries to speak with the giant zombie, Oz squishes him under his massive foot. It's shown, however, in chapter 483 that Hogback somehow survived from Oz's attack. Like many other characters in One Piece, Hogback has a unique laugh (fosfosfosfos). Many members of Thriller Bark seem to be based on old Horror movie character types; Hogback seems to be based on mad scientists, in particular Dr. Frankenstein. (Source: Wikipedia)"

He's usually seen frowning. Personality: Paulie is shown as the closest to and most trusted by Iceburg. He also shows a different outlook on the way many female characters in One Piece dress. Unlike most other characters such as Sanji, Paulie often becomes outraged at how much body women such as Nami and Kalifa show off when they are in the company of men. When he is first introduced, he tries to steal two suitcases full of money from Luffy to pay off his gambling debts. Though he is thwarted by Lucci, he still asks for 10% as a service fee. Fighting Style: Paulie has a unique fighting style; a complicated use of ropes that appear from under his sleeves. The amount of rope he carries is absurd, measuring hundreds, if not thousands of meters as he was actually able to make a huge, complex rope-work in a split-second to keep not only himself, but also the entire Franky Family, their Kingbulls, Oimo, and Kasshii from falling into the huge pit in Enies Lobby. He also boasts that the Galley-la rope he carries never breaks no matter what loads it carries. When he attacks, the ropes generally snake their way out his sleeve and wrap around the target. History: During the opening day of the Puffing Tom, a young Paulie was seen attending it's coronation.[2] Inspired by this event, Paulie decided to become a shipwright.

He has incredible reflexes, as he is able to instantly respond to Kizaru's light-speed movement and attacks to protect Whitebeard. He was also able to touch Kizaru, who is normally intangible due to his Logia ability. This may indicate that Marco is capable of using Haki. Marco possesses super-human strength, as shown when he kicked Kizaru down to the ground at extreme speed, however it is unclear if it's natural or comes from the fact that he is a zoan-user. Marco ate a Devil Fruit referred to as a Mythical Zoan that turns him into a Phoenix.

Along with being able to transform into a blue phoenix, the fruit allows him to regenerate any wounds with fire. It is a power that is said to be even rarer than Logia.

Three years ago, Morgan looks much like he does in the present storyline, except without the axe hand and the metal jaw. He was also of a slimmer build than in the present storyline. Prior to ""capturing"" Kuro, Morgan seemed to be a brave man who was not afraid of death. After his promotion, Morgan was corrupted by his power and became who he is today. When Morgan is first introduced, he is governing over the small island of Shell Town, where his Naval base is located. Yet he is ruling by fear, abusing his rank to make people pay taxes, and even going as far as killing his own men if they do not obey his commands. He has a very spoiled son named Helmeppo, who is just as bad at using his father's rank to get what he wants from the island's inhabitants. Morgan shows no sort of fatherly love for Helmeppo, even stating that Helmeppo was a worthless son not even worth hitting. Morgan's obsession with rank is proven in his battle against Luffy, where, despite not being able to to land a single blow on the rubberman (and having taken several), he would not accept defeat.

Kid has the same dream as Luffy, to find One Piece and become the new Pirate King. Because of this, and Luffy's recklessness, he seems to have a great deal of respect for him. However, while they often encounter the same problems, Kid deals with them in his own way, apparently killing everyone who ever laughed at his ambition. He also seems to believe that possessing the determination to achieve the impossible is necessary to survive in the New World. During the timeskip, his bounty became 470,000,000."

17003,Silk,シルク,Silk,https://myanimelist.net/character/17003/Silk,,"Silk was the abandoned child of a pirate and a character from Romance Dawn V.1. She aided Luffy in her efforts to defeat Crescent-Moon Galley when he attempted to take over the town she was living in. She said she had heard of Red-Haired Shanks when Luffy mentioned his saviour as a child and that he was one of the most famous pirates in the world. Several years later she is later seen on a ship alongside Crescent-Moon Galley telling her Captain (which was obviously Luffy) that land had been spotted. Silk was Oda's first attempt at a Nami-like character. She shares much of Nami's personality, however was much more kind and seemed to boast more leadership skills rather then relying on force to make people do things. Although that could be put down to Romance V.1 Luffy being far more intelligent then the final version. Appearance wise, aside from her hair being long everything about her (including her choice style of clothing) was almost identical to Nami. Her background story was much closer to Nami's own background story than Ann's background story was. Both girls were parentless at very young ages and both experienced their hometowns being subjected to pirate related suppression. The difference is that while Silk encouraged the townsfolk to stand up to the pirates, Nami did not want anyone to fight them through fear of someone being hurt. Coupled with this was the difference in reaction from the two hometowns - Silk's hometown did not want to fight the pirates where as Nami's were prepared to die trying.

Luffy first spots Galley's ship and decides to take it over so he won't have to sail in his dinghy. He defeats Galley's crew with ease and ties them up. The ship then lands at Silk's hometown and Galley escapes and his men escape and try to take revenge on Luffy. Luffy frightens them when they learn he is a Rubberman and they run away after. Luffy is then tied up by the townspeople, who think he is Galley. Galley then takes Luffy hostage and steals the town's treasure. He then enrages Luffy by smashing his hat, and gets Luffy thrown into the ocean. Luffy is then saved by Silk and uses Gomu Gomu no Axe to destroy Galley's ship. A livid Galley swears revenge. Galley is seen years later as a crewmember aboard Luffy's pirate ship, and tells him that land has been spotted. It seems that his encounter with Luffy changed him from a Morgaina pirate to a Peace Maine since Luffy said he wanted a crew made up of only Peace Maines -ANIME [Romance Dawn]- In the anime version of the Lougetown arc, there he is an elderly pirate called Galley of the Crescent Moon who has a bounty of 3,450,000.

He believed greatly in justice and honor. Ryuuma believed that when one gets saved, they must repay their debt else they don't have any values. He believed this was the way of a true swordsman. To this, Ryuuma would sometimes follow the request of someone he owes almost blindly, even when it would otherwise contradict his other philosophies. He also believed that a battle isn't measured by how much fame one gets from it, but by what was protected. As a swordsman, Ryuuma had this one particular habit. Whenever someone would touch their sword sheath with his, Ryuuma would immediately take it as a form of challenge for a duel to the death. This is because Ryuuma believed that the sword is a swordsman. For this, Ryuuma would then immediately fight the person whose sheath touched his. This was a particularly bad trait of his, despite his honorable intentions, as this would sometimes get him into trouble. Ryuuma, having heard the reputation of ""The King."" hoped to one day fight against him. He believed that this King holds a great ""Warrior's Soul"" and would make a worthy adversary. The irony however, is that he is ""The King."" Because the name, ""King,"" was given by the people he usually saved, he unfortunately didn't know it himself. Ryuuma also had a bad habit in managing money and when he ate food. Because of this, Ryuuma would often unfortunately find himself penniless and hungry for days. Ryuuma reappears in Eiichiro Oda's main series, One Piece as a revived zombie in the Thriller Bark Arc where he embodies the shadow of the recent Straw Hat Pirate Brook.

A statue of him was erected after his death as an eternal reminder to the Shandians of his strength and courage. He had a daughter named Musse. Wiper is a direct descendant of his. Calgara was quick to react and a strong believer in traditions of his people. He was hugely mistrusting of strangers.

He stood by his story even up till his execution. Norland was a brown haired man whose most distinct feature is a large chestnut on his head. This feauture was passed down to his descendants. He was a well built man who often wore a black coat and orange scarf. After his execution, Norland's image was distorted over the years due to the shame that was brought to his name. Since then, whenever someone refers to Norland, the image of an ever smiling idiot is the one that commonly comes into mind. This defacing image is the one often drawn by artists in children's books. His nose is shaped like a spork. The real Norland was a honest and good man who was brave and cared about people, despite what history remembers him as. He was happy-go-lucky and had a strong determination as well as being friendly. His only flaw seemed to have been acting without consulting people on things (such as cutting down the Shandians sacred trees), however he only did what he thought was (and usually is) best for people. The Norland who is depicted in the stories is a grinning fool who often went away on long expeditions only to return with stories that seemed unbelievable. In the end as far as the story was concerned, Norland pushed his luck with the bragging of a whole city of gold and it was a lie that cost him his dearly his life."

17763,Yorki,ヨーキ,Yorki,https://myanimelist.net/character/17763/Yorki,,"Appearance Yorki is a yellow haired pirate who typically wears a cowboy hat. He also has two tattoos on his face. One under his right eye and one under his lower lip. The tattoos resemble that Japanese Kanji (ヨ). He also wears a green captain's coat. In the anime, prior to his full appearance, he was depicted as a young brown haired tattoo less pirate that wore a tricone instead of the cowboy hat. His coat was also colored red instead of green. This was later changed in accordance to the manga's depiction. History Fifty years ago before the current timeline, as Yorki and his crew were sailing the West Blue, they came across a baby whale that was lost. Seeing that the whale was crying, Brook, one of Yorki's crew, suggested that they cheer the whale up with some music. Having cheered the thing up, the whale, Laboon, began following Yorki and the rest of the Rumbar Pirates through their adventures. As Yorki and crew drew nearer to the Grand Line however, Yorki and some of the other Rumbar Pirates asked Brook to convince Laboon to stay in the West Blue since he was the closest to the whale. This was because Yorki and the rest feared that Laboon was too young to face the dangers of the Grand Line. When Brook's attempt to convince Laboon failed, Yorki ordered his crew to ignore Laboon and not play any music in hopes that Laboon would stop following them. Grand Line Seemingly having convinced Laboon to stop following, Yorki and his crew sailed into the Grand Line through the Reverse Mountain. Upon arriving at the Grand Line, Yorki and his crew met up with Crocus and asked if they could stay to repair their ship. To their surprise then, they found out that Laboon had followed them into the Grand Line. For the next three months, Yorki and crew stayed to fix their ship whilst singing with Laboon all the while. Seeing that the Grand Line was just too dangerous for a young whale, Yorki asked Crocus to take care of Laboon while they ventured into the Grand Line. As Yorki and crew left Laboon in Crocus's care, they promised to return someday in two to three years and take Laboon back with them. While in the Grand Line, Yorki and his crew experienced all the hardships that the sea had to offer. Along the way, Yorki and his crew fought against a Marine base. For this attack, Yorki's bounty went up. Despite the challenges they encountered, Yorki and his crew sailed onwards. Disease However, after disembarking at a forest, Yorki and some of the other Rumbar Pirates contracted an incurable disease. In order to save the rest of the crew, Yorki decided to take himself and the other infected, and escape the Grand Line through the Calm Belt. With much regret, Yorki told the crew that were still well to give his regards to Laboon. As he lay dying, he asked Brook to play his favorite song to send him off. Yorki's attempt to escape was then written in a report. However the report misinterpreted Yorki's escape as an act of cowardice rather than show his actual reason. Anime and Manga Differences In the anime, prior to Yorki being properly shown in the manga, he was depicted as a typical tattoo less pirate wearing a typical tricone. This depiction of him was due to the unclear image of him during Crocus' flashback then in the manga. The image depicted Yorki shaking hands with Crocus however the captain's appearance was obscured along with the rest of the crew, with no indications at the time of the character Brook (who was noted as being thought up at the time of Laboon but not introduced until over three-hundred chapters later). The anime however changed this after he was fully revealed. Trivia Yorki's nickname resembles that of the real life pirate, Calico Jack. (source: http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Yorki )"

After Wapol declared any doctor not under his rule to be outlaws, he and Doctor Kureha were the only free doctors left. However, unlike Kureha, Hiluluk ended up doing more damage than good to his patients by accident. He found Chopper one day while traveling home in a blizzard. At first Chopper tried to knock him away, but Hiluluk earned his trust by showing that he didn't have any weapons or intention of hurting Chopper. From then on, the two slowly formed a sort of father/son relationship, traveling (and in a way terrorizing) the island trying to cure patients and generally resulting in them having to literally run for their lives from angry patients or their associates. In his early days, Hiluluk was a thief who was diagnosed with a fatal illness. What he believed cured him was the serene vision of a grove of cherry trees. After being cured, he came to believe that there is no disease in the world that cannot be cured. He had a complete change of heart and returned to Drum Island, the island he was born on, to help cure a dire illness. After one year had passed, Hiluluk reluctantly kicked Chopper out of his house, as he was going to die from a terminal illness (possibly tuberculosis). Hiluluk didn't want his friend to worry about him. After Chopper learned the truth, he went on a journey for an Amiudake mushroom, in which he came back brutally beaten which deeply broke and touched Hiluluk's heart. Sadly, unknown to the reindeer, the mushroom turned out be poisonous; but Hiluluk, who did know this, took it anyway because he was so moved by Chopper's concern from him. (Hiluluk had always called the jolly roger pirate emblem a symbol of vitality, which Chopper took literally, not realizing that the crossbones symbol in the medicine book he read meant that the mushroom was poisonous.) Afterward, Hiluluk heard news that Wapol's personal 20 doctors, the Isshi-20, were sick and rushed to the castle, only to find out it was a trap by Wapol to draw Hiluluk out and kill him. He thanked Chopper for a wonderful life just as Chopper was about to reach the castle. Hiluluk realized that his life would soon end and so, too, would his country if nothing was done about Wapol. Hiluluk truly believed that his country would be healed in time and his death would not be in vain. Thus with clear and hopeful eyes, and so as not to die from the poisonous medicine Chopper had made, he drank one of his own failed medicines and was blown up in an explosive blast.

She was the one who informed Luffy of all of the nine other pirates whose bounties exceed one hundred million beli. She also seems intent on keeping her age a secret; Luffy asked her how old she was when he heard that she had quit being a pirate forty years ago, but she immediately changed the subject.

She and her sisters are called the Gorgon sisters for supposedly heroically slaying a monster called the Gorgon. She is the younger sister of Boa Hancock and the elder sister of Boa Marigold. Appearance; Personality; Abilities and Powers; Devil Fruit; Trivia: Appearance: Sandersonia is a large woman who resembles a snake. Her large head is shaped like that of a snake's and her tongue is forked. Like the rest of the Kuja, she dresses in very revealing clothing. She is usually seen accompanied with the large panther, Bacura, at her side instead of a snake like the other Kuja. On her back, covered by her cape and her long green hair, is a mark of slavery branded on her by their previous Tenryuubito masters. It resembles a hoof mark and is a sign that means that she is ""less than human"" since she was a slave. Her sisters share this mark as well on their backs. Due to this shameful mark's meaning, Sandersonia and her sisters made their fellow Kuja believe that on their backs were a set of eyes she and her sisters received as part of a curse for slaying the Gorgon. They told them that these eyes turned anyone who sees them into stone. If any of the Kuja found out the truth, Sandersonia and her sisters would be forced to leave the island. Personality: Sandersonia appears very fond of her sister Hancock as noted by the fact she laughed at her sister's ""twisted"" personality. While she appears to be living on the lie that her sisters and herself defeated a Gorgon to gain their curse, at the same time she hasn't actually told a lie herself unlike Hancock who is constantly lying. Sandersonia is the most emotional of the 3 sisters and highly emotional about their past, her crying had to be eased by her sister Marigold and drove her to collapse onto the floor. In battle Sandersonia is a playful warrior who teases and torments her victims before she crushes them. Abilities and Powers: Ruling beside her sisters, Sandersonia has power over Amazon Lily and the rest of the Kuja women. Being a part of her sister's pirate crew, she is one of the elite Kuja warriors. She possesses an ability similar to the Mantra of the Sky Island Priests. Using this, she is able to read an opponent's movements and avoid their attacks. The reaction of the Kuja warriors implies that this is a form of Haki. While she can do this, she being able to read an opponent's movement, although it is useless if said opponent is drastically faster than she is. Devil Fruit: While she was a slave, Sandersonia was fed the Hebi Hebi no Mi, Model: Anaconda as part of some sick form of entertainment for her former Tenryuubito masters. This Devil Fruit allows her to turn into an anaconda. While these powers are Zoan Devil Fruit based, the Kuja of the island have been made to believe that Sandersonia's and Marigold's ability to turn into snakes is part of the curse the sisters made up. In their transformed forms, the other Kuja state that Sandersonia and Marigold can do a battle formation called Saragi Dance. Trivia: Her name comes from the flower Sandersonia. While Sandersonia and her sisters' title, the Gorgon Sisters, comes from supposedly slaying a monster with the same name, their concept is loosely based on the three actual mythological Gorgon sisters which includes the famous Medusa. Sandersonia is also able to convert her hair into snake-like, snake hair was another gorgon trait. (Source: One Piece Wiki)"

She is first seen accompanied with a large hawk at her side instead of a snake like the other Kuja. On her back, covered by her cape and her long hair, is believed by the Kuja, a set of eyes she and her sisters received as part of a curse for slaying the Gorgon. It is now known that the symbol on the Boa sisters' backs is the ""Hoof of the Soaring Dragon,"" an emblem burned upon the slaves of the Tenryuubito. Personality: Marigold is the stern one amongst the three sisters, who displays the least amount of emotions outside of battle. While she appears to be living on the lie that her sisters and herself defeated a Gorgon to gain their curse, at the same time she hasn't actually told a lie herself unlike Hancock who is constantly lying. In battle Marigold is an offensive warrior who is slightly playful (but not as playful as Sandersonia).

21093,Borsalino,ボルサリーノ,Borsalino,https://myanimelist.net/character/21093/Borsalino,,"Admiral Kizaru is one of the three Admirals in the Marines. His name means ""Yellow Monkey"" in Japanese while his original name was Borsalino. He was first mentioned by Robin during the initial encounter with Aokiji. Kizaru is a middle aged man with a moderate amount of wrinkles on his face. He has appeared in a yellow striped suit with the standard Marines' coat over it. He wears shades and a portable Den Den Mushi on his wrist. He is very tall, about the same height as Aokiji. The way Kizaru's character design is drawn resembles the famous Japanese actor, Kunie Tanaka. Kizaru's personality appears a combination of the more laid-back Aokiji and the more ruthless Akainu. Like Aokiji, Kizaru seems to be very laid-back and easygoing, even in surprising and unexpected situations, but he's apparently never shocked. Even when a pirate fired a gunshot at him, he seemed to be focused only on calling his subordinate, and didn't even mind. He even asked the offenders where his subordinate was. After uprooting a mangrove tree, he laughed to himself that the force he used was a tad excessive. He's also very calm and cool-headed, even in tense situations, such as when Basil Hawkins appeared unharmed by his attack, or when Rayleigh appeared. Unfortunately, he can be quite absent-minded and irresponsible, judged by the fact he used a lot of power in a kick directed at escaping pirates, uprooted an entire mangrove tree, and tried to call Sentoumaru with a black Den Den Mushi, which is only for intercepting communications. He also seems to prefer his original name, Borsalino, rather than his alias, as shown when Sentoumaru called him and he said, ""This is Borsalino"". However, more in line with Akainu, he is shown to have a ruthless side: he gives criminals, in particular pirates, very little mercy once he has targeted them. He even planned to capture Silvers Rayleigh, who had given up pirating over twenty years earlier, simply because he was the first mate of the Jolly Roger Pirates. Following the events of the Sabaody Archipelago, Kizaru has captured 500 pirates out of spite. Also like Smoker and Sengoku, he sees the Shichibukai as nothing more than just pirates, even if they are on the World Government's side. As an Admiral, Kizaru commands vast numbers of Marine troops that are under his rank. Most of all, he has the ability to order a Buster Call attack on any island. Kizaru possesses the power of the Pika Pika no Mi, meaning glimmer or light, a Logia-type Devil Fruit. As a Logia-user, he is able to let objects pass through him and reconstruct his body from energy particles. He's as fast as light. All of his attacks are based on the element of light, such as firing energy blasts from his finger tips or feet. His power is very destructive, causing huge explosions and easily destroying buildings. Kizaru has shown considerable skill with a sword as he is able to duel Silvers Rayleigh to a draw despite his loss of intangibility. (Source: One Piece Wiki)"

First Appearance: 	 Chapter 234; Episode 151 As the commander of the 3rd division of the Whitebeard Pirates, Jozu has authority over the lower-ranking subordinates. He was one of the few men unaffected by the powerful Haki released by the Yonkou Shanks. He is very experienced and a veteran of the Whitebeard pirates from the times of Gol D. Roger. He is one of the strongest members of the Whitebeard Pirates, as shown by his position as the 3rd division commander. During the Marineford war, Jozu was powerful enough to fight on par against the Shichibukai and the Marine Admirals. Jozu has outstanding brute strength, comparable to that of the Giant Squad Marines. He picked up and hurled an immense iceberg at a great distance at the giants protecting Marineford. The iceberg was so enormous that it appeared to be at least ten times as big as any of the giants. Thus, Jozu has demonstrated one of the greatest strength feats seen in the series. And, despite his massive body, his speed and reflexes are on par with his brute force; when he attacked Crocodile after the latter attempted to take Whitebeard's life, Crocodile commented on both the great speed and strength of the attack. Jozu has eaten a currently unnamed Devil Fruit that allows him to transform, parts and most likely all of his body, into diamond. This power has earned him the nickname  ""Diamond Jozu"". It is currently unknown if this is a Paramecia, like Supa Supa no Mi. Jozu's powers give him the ability to greatly increase his offensive and defensive powers. His already strong physical attacks are enhanced by the density of his diamond body. His defenses seem to enhance exponentially, and he is able to block the strongest slash in the world from the world's greatest swordsman, Shichibukai Juracule Mihawk, with no visible damage to himself. However, when his whole body is not in full diamond form, he is still vulnerable to Aokiji's freezing abilities. Other than that, Jozu is weak against the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.

Foxy is a cheater and trickster, who participates in the Davy Back Fight, a contest between pirate crews where the winning team can steal crew members from the losing team. Most members of Foxy's crew joined him because he won them in this contest. However, they seem to be genuinely enthusiastic about being in the Foxy pirates, and wholeheartedly cheer on their crewmates and captain in the Davy Back Fight. Though he acts supremely confident most of the time and seems quite fond of himself, Foxy is extremely sensitive to insults or criticism. Any offensive words from others cause him to instantly become depressed, and he usually ends up losing his footing and falling to the ground, barely supporting himself with his arms, while a black cloud suddenly appears over his head. Luckily for Foxy, all it takes is a few kind words from anybody to perk him up again. In the anime, Nami and Usopp used this weakness to their advantage by alternately hurling insults and compliments at Foxy non-stop, leaving him emotionally (as well as physically) paralyzed and unable to help his team during the roller race. Foxy is a cunning character who uses his Devil Fruit powers as well as various other tricks to aid in him cheating.

Appearance Magellan is a large man that greatly resembles a devil. He has bat wings, and a gargoyle-like face. He has horn-like ornaments on his head which he can pull out and use as weapons. Underneath them, he has short black twintail-styled hair. He towers over a regular sized person greatly. He also has very sharp teeth and his hands closely resemble those of the Blue Gorillas. Personality Magellan is a man with a rather distinct problem. Because of the powers of the Doku Doku no Mi, he delights in eating poisoned food. Though immune to the poison, he suffers from a severe case of diarrhea brought on from ingesting such poisonous meals. As a result, he spends approximately ten hours each day in the bathroom relieving himself. He is actually agoraphobic and enjoys dark, enclosed spaces. Though he only performs roughly four hours of duty as Warden of Impel Down due to his insistence to eat poisonous foods, despite the severe diarrhea, he still takes his role of keeping the prisoners in check seriously, and does not tolerate their bad behaviors. As he has permission to execute any one of them he sees fit, he shows no hesitation to drench them in his Hydra's lethal poison. Magellan also takes great pride in keeping Impel Down's reputation of being impenetrable and inescapable, and felt personally insulted when Monkey D. Luffy besmirched that record since Kinjishi the ""Flying Pirate"" 20 years ago. Magellan seems to find it amusing whenever someone he doesn't particularly like gets poisoned or suffocated by his powers, evident when he was seen chuckling at Hannyabal after he sighed a poisonous mist at the latter's direction. While he also does not tolerate Hannyabal's ""poisonous"" (the actual term used is punned with the word ""distant"") comments he himself is prone to use them against himself. His ruthlessness applies not only to the prisoners, but also to his own men, as seen berating a guard who was accidentally poisoned by his Hydra. Despite his ruthlessness and seriousness, Magellan was one of the many to fall for Boa Hancock's beauty, and neglected to hear the report of Luffy's intrusion when she requested to see Ace immediately, being completely head-over-heels over her. Abilities and Powers As the warden of Impel Down, Magellan has full control of the prison. However because of his constant diarrhea, he spends most of his time in the bathroom. Adding to fact that sleeps approximately eight hours per day and discounting meal times and breaks, he only works for approximately four hours per day doing his job. Nonetheless, he has both the authority and power to execute any of the prisoners in Impel Down as he sees fit. Devil Fruit Magellan had eaten the Doku Doku no Mi, a Devil Fruit that allows him to generate and manipulate poison. Magellan can produce these poison in different strength and forms, such as breathing simple minor gas to put subordinates in place, blowing tear gas bubbles to stun the opponents, or create extremely fatal liquid poison. His most infamous technique that is well known to most prisoners within the walls of Impel Down is a three-headed dragon called the Hydra, which is composed of corrosive liquid poison that causes lethal nerve-paralysis and melts the victims at the same time. His Hydra also had the power to easily defeat the Blackbeard Pirates with little to no effort. Because of the fruit's powers, Magellan is also able to eat poisoned food without killing himself, where instead it gives the food flavor. However, while he is immune to the poison, the food instead causes him to have diarrhea. This being a problem as he loves to eat poisoned food. (Source: One Piece Wikia)"

25380,Shepherd,,Shepherd,https://myanimelist.net/character/25380/Shepherd,,"Shepherd is a commander from Marine Headquarters that comes to G-8 in order to inspect it. He came to the base onboard the Stan Malay which suffered earlier from a storm upon arrival. He is the closest thing to an actual antagonist in the G-8 Arc as opposes both the Straw Hats and the G-8 Marines. However throughout the entire Arc, he has had all sorts of bad luck from being accused of being a Straw Hat called Condoriano to accidentally helping the Straw Hats numerous times. Shepherd is a grayish skinned man with a ponytail. He normally wears the official Marine over coat and purple clothes. These clothes and a pair of purple eye glasses were stolen by Robin when she assumed his identity. After he was freed from the brig, he regained his clothes but apparently not his eyeglasses. Shepherd thinks himself to be superior over other Marines due to his high rank. He would often threaten others with decommissions, court martial, and such unless his orders as followed or if things don't go his way. Shepherd thinks lowly of G-8 and it's commander, Johnathan. He believes that the base and Johnathan are completely useless due the base's reputation and the Vice Admiral's methods. Shepherd would thus do anything from writing a bad report to showing off the G-8 Marines just to see the base be decommissioned. Shepherd thinks so low of G-8 that he has refused help from Johnathan when the latter offers him some of the base's Marines to aid the inspector in locating the Straw Hats. Due to this stubbornness of his, Shepherd has thus done several actions that don't cooperate with the rest of G-8's attempts to capture the Straw Hats. The majority of these actions have ended unintentionally helping the Straw Hats out of tight jams. While Shepherd thinks himself to be superior, it has been shown that should the situation arise he shows a more cowardly side. This has been shown most prominent in a discussion between him and Johnathan. During the middle of the discussion, Shepherd decided to toy with Johnathan's fishing rod in order to mock the Vice Admiral. The normally calm Johnathan however responded to Shepherd's action in a tone which apparently made the inspector think otherwise. Shepherd's overall personality is somewhat akin to that of Spandam's. Shepherd possesses no special abilities or powers per say, however he does possess a special weapon called the Eagle Launcher. This extremely large bazooka is as he says is the latest and greatest portable bazooka that has been developed by the Marine Headquarters. It is as he says like the talons of a bird of prey hence it's name. It's power is on par with that of a small battleship. However despite the weapon's power, Shepherd isn't exactly an expert on using it. The weapon in fact unintentionally aids the Straw Hats several times than actually destroying them. Upon arrival in G-8, Shepherd is infuriated by having to weather a storm to get to the base and not having anyone welcome him. He refuses to disclose his rank and division to a lower ranked Marine, stating that he is a special VIP from the Marine Headquarters and needs not to disclose such information to the likes of the later. Shepherd then demands an audience with the commander in charge of the base, Johnathan. However due to the base's motto concerning food, Shepherd is denied it until the Vice Admiral finishes his lunch. Regardless, Shepherd decides to go to the Command Center by himself with plans to relieve Johnathan of his command with his report. However as soon as he walks into a hallway, he is attacked by Nico Robin, who assumes his identity after hiding him. Shepherd is identified as Condoriano by Usopp When he is later discovered, he is thought to be a member of the Straw Hat Pirates, with Usopp claiming he is really named Condoriano and he had lost his memory.[4] After some ruckus caused by the Straw Hats in the base, which included Robin as being identified as a Straw Hat in disguise, Shepherd's real identity is revealed and he is freed from prison. With all that's happened, Shepherd decides to take matters in his own hands in order to belittle Johnathan and the rest of G-8 when he learns the Straw Hats would come to retrieve their gold that had been confiscated earlier.[6] He does so regardless of the Stan Malay's captain's request to let their troops recover from the wounds they suffered from the storm. With his men, Shepherd confronts four of the Straw Hats that had been conered in the G-8 vault. With the intent of paying back the humiliation that was inflicted on him, Shepherd decides to handle the situation himself disregarding a fellow Marine's warning to not underestimate the Straw Hats. He then pulls out an extremely large bazooka, the Eagle Launcher and aims at the Straw Hats. However due to a mistake in holding the weapon in the wrong position, he instead fires it backwards. With a little help from Robin's ability, Shepherd's own weapon is then used on his own men and then later used to propel himself into the air. With Shepherd himself and the other Marines in the room temporarily knocked down by the Eagle Launcher, the four Straw Hats escape from them. With that, Shepherd then decides to execute his next tactic against the Straw Hats. With his forces on the Pine Peak, he orders them to intercept the Going Merry at the G-8 sea gate and sink it before the pirates before they could escape. Unfortunately this plan too goes wrong. The Pine Peak unintentionally showed the Straw Hats where the current was wherein they could steer Merry, which was disguised as a Marine battleship then. Shepherd's plan was then once again thwarted as the rest of Going Merry's disguise collided with the Pine Peak. Believing that the Straw Hats were finally going to escape, Shepherd decided to leave the rest to Johnathan's forces. Should the Vice Admiral fail to capture them, Shepherd threatened to hold Johnathan for everything that's happened. However in response, Johnathan simply replied to the Inspector to include in his report himself as being a hindrance in G-8's operations to capture the pirates. Shepherd then witnesses the base's special 9 o'clock low tide trap the Going Merry. Fearing that he will become nothing more than a nuisance in the whole affair, Shepherd snuck away from Johnathan and decides to use the Eagle Launcher on the Straw Hats one last time. However upon trying to aim at Luffy while the ship had become airborne thanks to Usopp's Impact Dial and the Octopus Balloon, Shepherd accidently shot the turret that was aiming at the octopus. His actions unfortunately aids the Straw Hats in escaping. After the incident, Shepherd returns to Johnathan and threatens to decommission the Vice Admiral for allowing the pirates to escape regardless of the fact that Johnathan is Admiral Akainu's protege. He is however met with Jessica, Johnathan's wife, punching him out in the face. As the Straw Hats leave G-8, and Johnathan and his wife laugh off the events that had happened, a knocked out Shepherd simply lies on the ground."

He also has a distinct laugh of his own which goes ""Hoh ke ke ke"". The laugh particularly almost sounds like the word ""Hockey"" with the second syllable repeated several times. Hockera is a bit of a trickster. He pretends to be dumber than he really is in order to catch opponents off guard.

He appears to have a grudge against Vegapunk, as well as a somewhat rational personality, as shown when he hid from the Marines instead of trying to fight them immediately, as well as trusting Monet's deduction that the Straw Hats might be more powerful than their bounties claim and waiting for Joker's approval to make his actions look like accidents, before starting attacks.

He also demonstrates tendencies of a superiority complex when Luffy mentioned his Gasu Gasu no Mi had no effect on his immune system due to Magellan's Doku Doku no Mi, both being poisonous Devil Fruits of differentiating class, and Caesar became rapidly aggravated in the fact of Luffy comparing his Logia powers to that of a ""mere"" paramecia user.

Because of his duplicitous conduct and allegiances he can be considered the secondary antagonist of the Punk Hazard Arc. Through his short discussion with Trafalgar Law, Vergo proved himself to be a shrewd man due to his mistrust of Caesar Clown, having Monet placed on the island to monitor his actions. He can also come across as somewhat condescending, mocking Law's position by pretending to have some respect for the Shichibukai. Seeing himself as above the Shichibukai, Vergo quickly reminds Law of the difference in their power by beating him unconscious. He's also shown to be a person who demands respect from others, such as when he demanded that Law refer to him as Vergo-san. Vergo stated that his favorite food is hamburgers. He appears to be a very messy eater, as he was first shown to have the hamburger still on the side of his cheek. While around citizens, Vergo is said to be an amiable person, much unlike the other G-5 Marines. The parents of the children kept on Punk Hazard trusted Vergo's words that all of the missing children died in an accident. His statement caused them to partly believe that they were truly gone, though some parents still believe that their children are alive. Easily deceiving both citizens and the entire Marines organization, Vergo has proven himself to be highly manipulative. Despite his perceived intelligence however, Vergo can at times seems to lapse into moments of air-headedness such as when he claimed to Caesar Clown that he had been enjoying coffee and cookies, only to be reminded shortly after that there had never been any cookies to begin with.

He believed deeply in justice and heroism, having joined the Marines simply to fulfill both desires, and resigning eventually when he realized the organization was not what it seemed. Originally a happy person, being popular among his subordinates and having created a loving family, his life changed for the worse when his wife and son were murdered by a pirate and his arm eventually severed by another, the latter who would become a Shichibukai; all of this loss and injustice led to a deep hatred towards pirates. He formed a group to take matters into his own hands and annihilate them all himself even if it also meant opposing the World Government and the Marines, and even raising a jolly roger. His strong hatred led to irrational acts such as plotting to destroy the New World to eradicate his enemies. Despite his loathing for pirates, he did have a sense of loyalty and respect to even his enemies to the bitter end, as he gave up his life to give time for his Neo Marines and the Straw Hat Pirates to escape from Kizaru, having come to respect the latter after their final battle. His Battle Smasher; the artificial arm/weapon he had made for him by a scientist after he lost his arm is used as decoration of his grave cross.

As the thugs are crushed and collapse into a hole in the ground, he says that being unable to see the world's filth could be considered an advantage of being blind. Everyone stands in awe after his display of power, the crew realizes that he must definitely have some Devil Fruit ability and Luffy immediately asks outright who exactly he is. Fujitora laughs and states that for both their sakes it would be unwise to reveal who he is. As he walked off, he gave the bartender a piece of paper and told him to forward all the damage claims to the address on it. He was later seen as a spectator in the Corrida Colosseum. He was apparently scouting out all the big names at the Colosseum, and said to his subordinates that they should leave. He requested 3 battleships and a large number of medical officers and said that he'll go to Green Bit first. Then, he asked his subordinate about the number of spectators, the population of the town, and of the country. When his subordinate asks why that is needed he replies that before counting the number of enemies they should count the number of people needing protection. When exacting retribution on Doflamingo's thugs that were cheating him because of his blindness, he used an unknown Devil Fruit. It has an ability to manipulate unseen force around a chosen location at his will. Firstly, he used this power to create an unseen force of such intensity that it caused the cheaters to be pressed heavily against the floor, which caved in to create a gigantic hole as a result. Later, he used immense amounts of this unseen force to accomplish other feats, such as causing a meteor to fall from the sky. He also uses this unseen force reversely to create a circular barrier around him which repels attacks. As a testament of his power, he stated the act he perform was merely testing his strength.

Bartolomeo is a lean yet muscular man. He has light green-colored hair in a wild rocker-like style and no eyebrows. He has a demonic looking face, sharp fangs, and a ring piercing on his nasal septum. There are two lines tattooed under his right eye that curve towards his ear. He has a dark tattoo on his chest of a thick ring with an opening on the top, wings on the sides, and long fangs on the bottom. He wears a dark purple coat with a stripe down each sleeve and a plumed collar and cuffs. On the back of it is a face with its head on fire with two crossing sabers just underneath it. He has a light-colored ring-patterned belt with a chain on the left. He has a weapon tucked in the front of his baggy checkered trousers, and has light ruffled dark boots on his feet. Bartolomeo can be rather vulgar and laid-back at times. He is also very provocative, but also mocks his opponents, usually in a nonchalant manner. Even when attempting to stay cool, however, Bartolomeo can become angered when provoked in return. Bartolomeo also doesn't care what anyone else thinks of him and does not seem to hold a high opinion of people. However, Bartolomeo seems to care for his crew (or at least its reputation). Despite the cruelty he shows to others, he has immense respect for the Straw Hat Pirates. After witnessing Luffy's miraculous survival on the execution stand in Loguetown two years ago, Bartolomeo became a massive fan of Luffy's and views him as his hero, even to the point of worshipping him. After following Luffy's exploits up till the Battle of Marineford, he was inspired to start his life of piracy. His respect for Luffy is so deep that he gets angry and attacks people who mock Luffy as when he squashed a man against a wall with his Devil Fruit powers and even cuts the man's tongue right after he badmouthed Luffy. Bartolomeo also expressed shyness towards Luffy as he hesitated to speak to him face to face. Bartolomeo has been shown to get easily excited when he sees the people he idolizes as when he saw Zoro, he burst into tears out of joy. He weeps uncontrollably even when doing something as simple as asking Zoro for an autograph. When he came face to face with Luffy, he screamed in joy. It has been revealed that he only entered the tournament in order to give Luffy the Mera Mera no Mi. Bartolomeo ate the Bari Bari no Mi, a Paramecia type Devil Fruit which allows him to be a Barrier Human. He uses his Devil Fruit powers both to protect himself and attack his opponents. The barriers are seemingly indestructible. He can also use his barriers to attack his enemies. (Source: One Piece Wikia)"

When in battle, she changes into revealing armor made of gold and a red lingerie underneath. Baccarat acts friendly and composed to visitors to Gran Tesoro, guiding them through the city and encouraging them to make more money and live in luxury. However, she does this in order to get them to lose everything and be forced to work to repay their debt. Should the visitors continue getting lucky, Baccarat will not hesitate to use her abilities to take away their luck. She is also very manipulative, as she faked a leg injury in order to get Sanji closer and allow her to take his luck away. Baccarat is very confident in her Devil Fruit ability, which causes her to be very arrogant in battle and believe that she cannot lose. Thus, should someone's luck be greater than hers, she will be bewildered. Her overconfidence led to her downfall when she outright did not bother to avoid Usopp's attack, as she did not notice that he depleted her luck with a hidden slot machine. Baccarat ate the Raki Raki no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that gives her the ability to steal the good luck of anyone she touches. Anyone who has their luck stolen will be met with a rapid series of unfortunate events and accidents. She often uses this ability on the guests of the casino to make them lose games, putting them in enormous debt, thus forcing them to slave away working for Gran Tesoro. By stealing enough luck, Baccarat herself becomes extremely lucky, which makes her almost invincible in battle, since most attacks will miss her, and even something as simple as throwing a coin will cause a chain reaction of disasters to befall and harm her opponents. However, this stolen luck does not last forever and will eventually disappear if too many fortunate events happen to her. At some point after the events at Gran Tesoro, Baccarat and Gedatsu were seen walking together enjoying the Pirates Festival in One Piece: Stampede. (Source: One Piece Wiki)"

She wears a frilly white top with green sleeves that exposes her midriff and has a necktie whose design is based on Tokyo Tower. She wears a large skirt with green and white stripes that has a large number of black frills lining the bottom and wears green tights as well as green heels. She wears two bows, both of which are orange on the right side and have yellow and green stripes on the left. One bow is on the top of her head, while the other is on the back of her skirt. Ann is a kind but ditzy girl. She quickly made friends with the Straw Hat Pirates, and she also is thoughtful enough to have asked Luffy if he wanted to see Ace again. However, she often gets easily distracted and forgets what she is doing until others remind her, including when she is performing or asking for help Ann has a bright, spunky personality and puts a lot of spirit into her announcing during the Pirates Expo. She is not shy about her bias, actively cheering for Luffy and his crew. She is also somewhat of a diva in personality, getting frustrated at her co-announcer Donald Moderate for cutting off her sentences and stealing his microphone to goad her ego. Ann ate the Bijo Bijo no Mi, a Paramecia-class Devil Fruit that allows the user to create ""phantoms,"" or illusory images, by touching pictures. She can create phantoms of objects, plants, and even people that can then interact with their environment. One Piece: Phantom Ann returned to Tongari Island and put on a special homecoming concert at Live Music Club TONGARI. DJ Parrot introduced Ann and her abilities and welcomed her to the stage. She began to perform, but the Straw Hat Pirates, except for Robin, Franky, and Brook, came to see her perform, she interacted with them and forgot that she was performing. She continued to perform after the pirates reminded her, demonstrating her powers by creating phantoms of a bunch of flowers and a group of Kung-Fu Dugongs (Karoo in the second term of the show) on an island. Suddenly, Buggy appeared and captured Ann, explaining that he wanted to use her phantoms to help capture the Straw Hat Pirates and sell them to the Marines. Buggy forced Ann to create phantoms of several of the crew's allies to confuse them while Puggy apprehended them one by one. Ann was then forced to create a phantom of Sabo to confuse Luffy. Luffy knocked Buggy and Puggy away, freeing Ann and the others. Ann thanked him and offered to create a phantom of Ace. Luffy declined, and they all decide to restart Ann's concert. As they are singing and dancing together, Buggy returns. Ann creates a phantom of Ace without Luffy's knowledge, which helps Luffy defeat the Shichibukai member. DJ Parrot announced that the concert will continue, and Ann parts ways with the crew after they finish singing together. One Piece: Marionette Ann was performing another concert on Tongari Island when a resident of the island ran onto the stage, warning her to run. The resident was sprayed with marionette gas by Caesar Clown, and Caesar manipulated the resident to charge at Ann. Before the resident could hurt Ann, Sabo intervened and stopped him. Ann watched as Caesar tricked Sabo into inhaling the gas and ran to find help once Sabo was under Caesar's control. Ann ran into the Straw Hat Pirates on the island's beach and asked them for help. Luffy asked her to make a phantom of meat for him, but the rest of the crew reminded her that she had wanted their help. She was about to tell them about Sabo when he attacked them and appeared. Ann watched the crew fight Sabo. After Zoro got sprayed with marionette gas by Caesar, she and Usopp sent Chopper through a secret passageway to the Thousand Sunny to develop an antidote. She continued to watch the fight as Caesar took control of Sanji and Usopp. As the four under Caesar's control prepared to attack, Luffy asked Ann to create a phantom of Vinsmoke Reiju to remove the poison gas from them. Ann watched as Charlotte Cracker joined Caesar and as the Straw Hat Pirates defeated them. With the island saved, Ann observed the crew's antics and commented on how nice it must be to have friends. The crew affirmed to her that they were her friends, and they all sang and danced together before the Straw Hat Pirates and Sabo departed. One Piece: Stampede: When Donald Moderate began moderating the Pirates Expo and the main event, a hunt for Roger's treasure, he introduced Ann to the crowd as a guest announcer and explained her Devil Fruit abilities. Ann demonstrated her powers by creating a projection resembling Dragon Number Thirteen and exclaimed her excitement for the treasure hunt. The pair moderated, with Ann enthusiastically supporting the Straw Hat Pirates, but they became terrified when they realized that Douglas Bullet was present. They continued to moderate the battle until they learned of the Marines' Buster Call, at which point they fled. Later, Ann was taken aboard the Revolutionary Army's ship and given a coat by Koala to keep her warm. As the Marines launched their second Buster Call and began clashing with the Worst Generation pirate crews, Sabo instructed Ann to create a projection of Ace. Sabo and Ace's projection launched joint Hikens, creating a path for Luffy and the other Super Rookies to escape the Marines safely. Ann and the Revolutionary Army parted ways when she boarded the Takoyaki 8 with Hatchan, Camie, and Pappag."

Sommers has a twisted, sadistic personality and cares little for the feelings of those beneath him. He has an abstract belief of the concept of ""Love"", stating that loving is about ""hurting one another"", and uses this viewpoint to fuel his interest in pain and agony, thinking that the tragedy of, for example, a parent dying for their child is an exciting, beautiful prospect, casually and nonchalantly admitting so in front of his fellow God's Knights. Sommers seems to apply the concept of love to a lot of different situations, such as when Robin charged at him, he asked her if she was in love with him. In spite of his cruel character, Sommers has his own dense, humorous moments, such as not registering that he had been summoned to Elbaph in his underwear, believing that Gunko and Figarland Shamrock were in fact visiting his mansion instead. Sommers also does recognize Luffy as an Emperor of the Sea and would rather not want to put up a fight with him, though he was reprimanded by Killingham beforehand when Sommers congratulated Gunko on capturing the Straw Hat crew and beating up Brook. In addition, Sommers also has no issues with revealing the God's Knights mission and ultimate goal when they were sent to Elbaph, as he broadcast their objective all across Elbaph, fully wanting to execute the World Government's absolute domination over the giants. He even went so far as to combine their objectives with his cruel side, as he told the shocked giants that they would kill each of the children they had captured one by one if their demands were not met, playing into his personality of total disregard for other lives while gaining benefits for himself or the World Government. He believed that academic pursuits and historical retention to be completely worthless for warriors of Elbaph, demanding both to be abolished. This complete lack of empathy even went so far as he disregarded Ange's pleas for the Owl Library's vast collection of books to be preserved, calling her out and ignoring her pleas. Due to his immortality, Sommers is very relaxed during his missions, as he continued his broadcast completely unbothered when Robin attacked him and dealt otherwise lethal injuries to him. However, should his regeneration fail to heal him, he seems to fall into a panic. According to his fellow knight Killingham, Sommers is a gourmet with good taste in food. He also enjoys live musical performances, albeit, by his own admission, he is very strict against mistakes and will punish anyone who plays imperfectly. Unlike most World Nobles, Saint Sommers appears to be more informed of the goings on of the ""Lower World"" and calmer in handling the crisis of the food shortage ravaging the Holy Land.

Killingham is a very careless, clumsy man who has trouble with punctuality. He appears to suffer from narcolepsy, tending to fall asleep in inopportune moments and even talking during sleep. As such, he tends to remain rather serene and lethargic when not fretting about his duties as a knight. Killingham tends to be cautious when dealing with powerful enemies, as he was aware of Luffy's status as an Emperor of the Sea and his reputation, and did not want to unnecessarily break protocol and antagonize Luffy for little reason, scolding Sommers when he suggested taking the Straw Hats as captives. Killingham does prefer to complete missions quickly and rationally as he did not want to stay too long lazing around on Elbaph. Killingham ate the Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Kirin, a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that grants him the ability to transform into a one-horned, long-necked qilin. Killingham appears to have ""awakened"" this ability while maintaining his personality, as indicated by the ribbon of flaming smoke around his head and torso when he is transformed. Killingham has the ability to cause other people to fall asleep from a distance, with groups of giant children collapsing all at once and then sleepwalking toward a desired location. He can also manifest the dreams of sleeping individuals, creating delicious-tasting zero-calorie food, and manifesting monsters called MMA, which are far larger than even giants. This ability can cause widespread destruction on its own and becomes even deadlier when used in unison with other Devil Fruit abilities such as Sommers's Iba Iba no Mi abilities to turn his victims into death traps. Powers and abilities: - Killingham bears a mark that grants him the ability to use magic circles, known as the Abyss, as a means of transport - Has a form of immortality, as all of Saint Knights - Killingham possesses Haki. His arrival on Elbaph was accompanied by a massive burst of Haki which resembled black lightning. His Haki was sensed by Scopper Gaban and described as being abnormal. - Killingham wields a strange-looking trident with asymmetric blades. He has yet to be seen using it in battle. He later wielded a bow and arrow, which he used to burn down the Owl Library. He also has been shown using a horn to call upon and command his MMAs (Source: One Piece Wiki)"

He is a broad-shouldered giant who sported jagged eyebrows and a curved double-line tattoo framing his left temple. Due to his lineage as a descendant of ancient giants, Harald was taller than most modern giants and was born with a pair of horns poking from his head. In his younger days as a 45-year old man, Harald had a lean, muscular physique similar to that of his son Loki. He had a full head of short dark hair. Toward the end of his life, Harald was a compassionate pacifist by nature. In his position as the ruler of the Warland Kingdom, Harald favored diplomacy and trading with other countries over waging war, as the giants of old were known for, and started a series of reforms intended to turn Elbaph into a more peaceful nation. Because of his hatred of violence, he even went so far as to cut off the horns growing on his own head so that they would not remind him of the aggressiveness of his ancestors. He was considered to be a wise and great king despite his idealism being unpopular with his elder kinsmen like Jarul. Abilities: - As a giant with the blood of the ancient giants, Harald was larger and considerably more powerful than the average giant. His monstrous power is evident in the destruction caused in his final fight against Loki. As king of Elbaph, he commanded an entire military of giants, which is said to be the strongest in the entire world. Rocks D. Xebec, one of the most powerful pirates in history, held Harald's strength in high regard, and asked him multiple times to become a member of his crew (which held as one of the strongest powerful crew of its time). - Remarkably Harald once leapt from the top of the Red Line and fell a huge distance without issues, a feat which shocked Rocks D. Xebec, who had kidnapped five kings, killed an Admiral, and had a secret meeting with Imu merely moments before. Harald is very strong if comes to brutal force. - Harald is one of the few people in the world known to possess Supreme King Haki. Harald's Haki was powerful enough to clash evenly with that of Rocks D. Xebec, who would come to be recognized as one of the strongest men in the world along with Gol D. Roger and Monkey D. Garp. - Harald had a huge sword, with which he was capable of clashing evenly with a sword strike from Rocks D. Xebec. He was murdered 14 years ago, allegedly by his son Loki.
