Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D''s.

His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef "Red Leg" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue. Sanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his "love-cook" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname "ero-cook," or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around women, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can''t attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a "strict upbringing." To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur. His goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe. Being the crew''s chef, he looks out for the health of his crewmates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others'' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He''s also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well. In short, he cares as much for the crew as any Straw Hat should, but unlike Zoro, Sanji shows these feelings more. It is revealed that Sanji is the third son of the Vinsmokes, a family of killers.

This is often problematic in his fighting as he can''t attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a "strict upbringing." To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur. His goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe. Being the crew''s chef, he looks out for the health of his crewmates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others'' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He''s also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well. In short, he cares as much for the crew as any Straw Hat should, but unlike Zoro, Sanji shows these feelings more. It is revealed that Sanji is the third son of the Vinsmokes, a family of killers. His father and one of the Yonkou, Big Mom, had arranged a marriage between him and the 35th daughter of the Charlotte family, Pudding during the strawhats time on Zoe/Dressrosa.'

When weaker members of his crew were hurt, Arlong would seek out revenge on those who had committed the act against those crew members. Ironically, Arlong is a hypocrite, having accused Koala of being raised to look down on fishmen and think of humans as better than everyone else, when Arlong looked down on humans and preached fishmen superiority himself, making him no better than the humans. Surprisingly despite his hatred of humanity according to Hatchan, Arlong would never harm his fellow fishmen no matter the circumstance. He cared for his crew to a level that when Luffy used one of them as a shield, Arlong became extremely angry.' WHERE name = 'Arlong';

He is loved by the people of Water 7, especially by all of his workers. They enjoy his company and often ask for his opinion and input on anything having to do with building ships. Iceburg at times seems to have two different personalities. Sometimes, he acts in a very childish way, canceling all of his meetings so that he can show people around, refusing to meet with people because he doesn''t like them, finding animals on the ground and taking care of them, and other such behaviors. He currently has a mouse that he named "Tyrannosaurus". However, when the time comes, he can be very serious, and it becomes clear that his childishness is only when he is relaxed. Iceburg was the holder of the plans to Pluton for four years after Tom''s death. After those four years, he secretly gave them to Franky, Tom''s other apprentice that Iceburg had known since the two were children. However, as this was done in secret, the government still believes that Iceburg is in possession of the plans. As such, some officials come to try and get them from him on a regular basis. Iceburg also believed that Nico Robin deserved death because she was the only person alive who could decipher the ancient Poneglyphs that could revive Pluton. He tries to kill her during the Water 7 arc, but later believes that he was wrong about her and that she is a good person.

They enjoy his company and often ask for his opinion and input on anything having to do with building ships. Iceburg at times seems to have two different personalities. Sometimes, he acts in a very childish way, canceling all of his meetings so that he can show people around, refusing to meet with people because he doesn''t like them, finding animals on the ground and taking care of them, and other such behaviors. He currently has a mouse that he named "Tyrannosaurus". However, when the time comes, he can be very serious, and it becomes clear that his childishness is only when he is relaxed. Iceburg was the holder of the plans to Pluton for four years after Tom''s death. After those four years, he secretly gave them to Franky, Tom''s other apprentice that Iceburg had known since the two were children. However, as this was done in secret, the government still believes that Iceburg is in possession of the plans. As such, some officials come to try and get them from him on a regular basis. Iceburg also believed that Nico Robin deserved death because she was the only person alive who could decipher the ancient Poneglyphs that could revive Pluton. He tries to kill her during the Water 7 arc, but later believes that he was wrong about her and that she is a good person.

The shadow acts a second soul, duplicating its owner''s movements and mannerisms. Moria creates zombies by inserting a shadow into a lifeless corpse. Coupled with physiologically enhanced bodies engineered by Hogback, he is able to create powerful and obedient zombie warriors. However, if the original owner of the shadow dies, the zombie created from that person''s shadow will also die. As a result, Moria has the de-shadowed people placed on their ship and removed from Thriller Bark. He is an extremely large man and has a devil-like appearance, mainly due to his horns and shadowy figure. His size is equivalent to fellow Shichibukai member Bartholomew Kuma, but he creates smaller (but still impressively large) shadow clones to do his work. He wields a pair of gigantic scissors that he uses to cut the shadows of his victims from their bodies upon seizing them. He is a very calm person and is not even bothered by the fact that his ship and crew are being destroyed. He also has X like marks above his nose and below his chin that may be stitches. Moria''s motto is to rely on others to reach his goals. His favorite phrase is: "You do it!", reflecting his slothful personality and tendency to leave all work for his underlings. This also expands to his fighting style, as he prefers to lay back and let his own shadow, Doppelman, who he can switch places with at any time, battle with the powers of the Kage Kage no Mi.

In the anime, prior to his full appearance, he was depicted as a young brown haired tattoo less pirate that wore a tricone instead of the cowboy hat. His coat was also colored red instead of green. This was later changed in accordance to the manga''s depiction. History Fifty years ago before the current timeline, as Yorki and his crew were sailing the West Blue, they came across a baby whale that was lost. Seeing that the whale was crying, Brook, one of Yorki''s crew, suggested that they cheer the whale up with some music. Having cheered the thing up, the whale, Laboon, began following Yorki and the rest of the Rumbar Pirates through their adventures. As Yorki and crew drew nearer to the Grand Line however, Yorki and some of the other Rumbar Pirates asked Brook to convince Laboon to stay in the West Blue since he was the closest to the whale. This was because Yorki and the rest feared that Laboon was too young to face the dangers of the Grand Line. When Brook''s attempt to convince Laboon failed, Yorki ordered his crew to ignore Laboon and not play any music in hopes that Laboon would stop following them. Grand Line Seemingly having convinced Laboon to stop following, Yorki and his crew sailed into the Grand Line through the Reverse Mountain. Upon arriving at the Grand Line, Yorki and his crew met up with Crocus and asked if they could stay to repair their ship. To their surprise then, they found out that Laboon had followed them into the Grand Line. For the next three months, Yorki and crew stayed to fix their ship whilst singing with Laboon all the while. Seeing that the Grand Line was just too dangerous for a young whale, Yorki asked Crocus to take care of Laboon while they ventured into the Grand Line. As Yorki and crew left Laboon in Crocus''s care, they promised to return someday in two to three years and take Laboon back with them. While in the Grand Line, Yorki and his crew experienced all the hardships that the sea had to offer. Along the way, Yorki and his crew fought against a Marine base. For this attack, Yorki''s bounty went up. Despite the challenges they encountered, Yorki and his crew sailed onwards. Disease However, after disembarking at a forest, Yorki and some of the other Rumbar Pirates contracted an incurable disease. In order to save the rest of the crew, Yorki decided to take himself and the other infected, and escape the Grand Line through the Calm Belt. With much regret, Yorki told the crew that were still well to give his regards to Laboon. As he lay dying, he asked Brook to play his favorite song to send him off. Yorki''s attempt to escape was then written in a report. However the report misinterpreted Yorki''s escape as an act of cowardice rather than show his actual reason. Anime and Manga Differences In the anime, prior to Yorki being properly shown in the manga, he was depicted as a typical tattoo less pirate wearing a typical tricone. This depiction of him was due to the unclear image of him during Crocus'' flashback then in the manga. The image depicted Yorki shaking hands with Crocus however the captain''s appearance was obscured along with the rest of the crew, with no indications at the time of the character Brook (who was noted as being thought up at the time of Laboon but not introduced until over three-hundred chapters later).

At first Chopper tried to knock him away, but Hiluluk earned his trust by showing that he didn''t have any weapons or intention of hurting Chopper. From then on, the two slowly formed a sort of father/son relationship, traveling (and in a way terrorizing) the island trying to cure patients and generally resulting in them having to literally run for their lives from angry patients or their associates.

After one year had passed, Hiluluk reluctantly kicked Chopper out of his house, as he was going to die from a terminal illness (possibly tuberculosis).

Afterward, Hiluluk heard news that Wapol''s personal 20 doctors, the Isshi-20, were sick and rushed to the castle, only to find out it was a trap by Wapol to draw Hiluluk out and kill him. He thanked Chopper for a wonderful life just as Chopper was about to reach the castle. Hiluluk realized that his life would soon end and so, too, would his country if nothing was done about Wapol.

Her large head is shaped like that of a snake''s and her tongue is forked. Like the rest of the Kuja, she dresses in very revealing clothing. She is usually seen accompanied with the large panther, Bacura, at her side instead of a snake like the other Kuja. On her back, covered by her cape and her long green hair, is a mark of slavery branded on her by their previous Tenryuubito masters. It resembles a hoof mark and is a sign that means that she is "less than human" since she was a slave. Her sisters share this mark as well on their backs. Due to this shameful mark''s meaning, Sandersonia and her sisters made their fellow Kuja believe that on their backs were a set of eyes she and her sisters received as part of a curse for slaying the Gorgon. They told them that these eyes turned anyone who sees them into stone. If any of the Kuja found out the truth, Sandersonia and her sisters would be forced to leave the island. Personality: Sandersonia appears very fond of her sister Hancock as noted by the fact she laughed at her sister''s "twisted" personality. While she appears to be living on the lie that her sisters and herself defeated a Gorgon to gain their curse, at the same time she hasn''t actually told a lie herself unlike Hancock who is constantly lying. Sandersonia is the most emotional of the 3 sisters and highly emotional about their past, her crying had to be eased by her sister Marigold and drove her to collapse onto the floor. In battle Sandersonia is a playful warrior who teases and torments her victims before she crushes them. Abilities and Powers: Ruling beside her sisters, Sandersonia has power over Amazon Lily and the rest of the Kuja women. Being a part of her sister''s pirate crew, she is one of the elite Kuja warriors. She possesses an ability similar to the Mantra of the Sky Island Priests. Using this, she is able to read an opponent''s movements and avoid their attacks. The reaction of the Kuja warriors implies that this is a form of Haki. While she can do this, she being able to read an opponent''s movement, although it is useless if said opponent is drastically faster than she is. Devil Fruit: While she was a slave, Sandersonia was fed the Hebi Hebi no Mi, Model: Anaconda as part of some sick form of entertainment for her former Tenryuubito masters. This Devil Fruit allows her to turn into an anaconda. While these powers are Zoan Devil Fruit based, the Kuja of the island have been made to believe that Sandersonia''s and Marigold''s ability to turn into snakes is part of the curse the sisters made up.

She possesses the ability to use Haki to defend and deflect against attacks, even against other Devil Fruit users. While she can do this, she can''t block an opponent''s attack if it is too strong for her, like Luffy''s Gear Second attacks. Devil Fruit: Marigold ate the Hebi Hebi no Mi, Model: King Cobra that allows her to turn into a King Cobra. While these powers are Zoan Devil Fruit based, the Kuja of the island attribute Marigold''s and Sandersonia''s ability to turn into snakes as part of the curse. Trivia: Her name comes from the flower Marigold. While Marigold and her sisters'' title, the Gorgon Sisters, comes from supposedly slaying a monster with the same name, their concept is loosely based on the three actual mythological Gorgon sisters which includes the famous Medusa.

His name means "Yellow Monkey" in Japanese while his original name was Borsalino. He was first mentioned by Robin during the initial encounter with Aokiji. Kizaru is a middle aged man with a moderate amount of wrinkles on his face. He has appeared in a yellow striped suit with the standard Marines'' coat over it. He wears shades and a portable Den Den Mushi on his wrist. He is very tall, about the same height as Aokiji. The way Kizaru''s character design is drawn resembles the famous Japanese actor, Kunie Tanaka. Kizaru''s personality appears a combination of the more laid-back Aokiji and the more ruthless Akainu. Like Aokiji, Kizaru seems to be very laid-back and easygoing, even in surprising and unexpected situations, but he''s apparently never shocked. Even when a pirate fired a gunshot at him, he seemed to be focused only on calling his subordinate, and didn''t even mind. He even asked the offenders where his subordinate was. After uprooting a mangrove tree, he laughed to himself that the force he used was a tad excessive. He''s also very calm and cool-headed, even in tense situations, such as when Basil Hawkins appeared unharmed by his attack, or when Rayleigh appeared. Unfortunately, he can be quite absent-minded and irresponsible, judged by the fact he used a lot of power in a kick directed at escaping pirates, uprooted an entire mangrove tree, and tried to call Sentoumaru with a black Den Den Mushi, which is only for intercepting communications. He also seems to prefer his original name, Borsalino, rather than his alias, as shown when Sentoumaru called him and he said, "This is Borsalino". However, more in line with Akainu, he is shown to have a ruthless side: he gives criminals, in particular pirates, very little mercy once he has targeted them. He even planned to capture Silvers Rayleigh, who had given up pirating over twenty years earlier, simply because he was the first mate of the Jolly Roger Pirates. Following the events of the Sabaody Archipelago, Kizaru has captured 500 pirates out of spite. Also like Smoker and Sengoku, he sees the Shichibukai as nothing more than just pirates, even if they are on the World Government''s side. As an Admiral, Kizaru commands vast numbers of Marine troops that are under his rank. Most of all, he has the ability to order a Buster Call attack on any island. Kizaru possesses the power of the Pika Pika no Mi, meaning glimmer or light, a Logia-type Devil Fruit. As a Logia-user, he is able to let objects pass through him and reconstruct his body from energy particles. He''s as fast as light. All of his attacks are based on the element of light, such as firing energy blasts from his finger tips or feet. His power is very destructive, causing huge explosions and easily destroying buildings. Kizaru has shown considerable skill with a sword as he is able to duel Silvers Rayleigh to a draw despite his loss of intangibility.

Lulu constantly has part of his hair sticking up. When he tries to push it down, it always pops up somewhere else, such as the other side of his head, his mustache, and other people''s heads. In most situations this is simply humorous, with other characters looking at him funny for it or simply ignoring the oddness. However, at times it actually comes in handy; in battle, Lulu can make the hair come out of somebody''s nose to distract them, leaving them open for him to attack.

Underneath them, he has short black twintail-styled hair. He towers over a regular sized person greatly. He also has very sharp teeth and his hands closely resemble those of the Blue Gorillas. Personality Magellan is a man with a rather distinct problem. Because of the powers of the Doku Doku no Mi, he delights in eating poisoned food. Though immune to the poison, he suffers from a severe case of diarrhea brought on from ingesting such poisonous meals. As a result, he spends approximately ten hours each day in the bathroom relieving himself. He is actually agoraphobic and enjoys dark, enclosed spaces. Though he only performs roughly four hours of duty as Warden of Impel Down due to his insistence to eat poisonous foods, despite the severe diarrhea, he still takes his role of keeping the prisoners in check seriously, and does not tolerate their bad behaviors. As he has permission to execute any one of them he sees fit, he shows no hesitation to drench them in his Hydra''s lethal poison. Magellan also takes great pride in keeping Impel Down''s reputation of being impenetrable and inescapable, and felt personally insulted when Monkey D. Luffy besmirched that record since Kinjishi the "Flying Pirate" 20 years ago. Magellan seems to find it amusing whenever someone he doesn''t particularly like gets poisoned or suffocated by his powers, evident when he was seen chuckling at Hannyabal after he sighed a poisonous mist at the latter''s direction. While he also does not tolerate Hannyabal''s "poisonous" (the actual term used is punned with the word "distant") comments he himself is prone to use them against himself. His ruthlessness applies not only to the prisoners, but also to his own men, as seen berating a guard who was accidentally poisoned by his Hydra. Despite his ruthlessness and seriousness, Magellan was one of the many to fall for Boa Hancock''s beauty, and neglected to hear the report of Luffy''s intrusion when she requested to see Ace immediately, being completely head-over-heels over her. Abilities and Powers As the warden of Impel Down, Magellan has full control of the prison. However because of his constant diarrhea, he spends most of his time in the bathroom. Adding to fact that sleeps approximately eight hours per day and discounting meal times and breaks, he only works for approximately four hours per day doing his job. Nonetheless, he has both the authority and power to execute any of the prisoners in Impel Down as he sees fit. Devil Fruit Magellan had eaten the Doku Doku no Mi, a Devil Fruit that allows him to generate and manipulate poison. Magellan can produce these poison in different strength and forms, such as breathing simple minor gas to put subordinates in place, blowing tear gas bubbles to stun the opponents, or create extremely fatal liquid poison. His most infamous technique that is well known to most prisoners within the walls of Impel Down is a three-headed dragon called the Hydra, which is composed of corrosive liquid poison that causes lethal nerve-paralysis and melts the victims at the same time. His Hydra also had the power to easily defeat the Blackbeard Pirates with little to no effort. Because of the fruit''s powers, Magellan is also able to eat poisoned food without killing himself, where instead it gives the food flavor. However, while he is immune to the poison, the food instead causes him to have diarrhea. This being a problem as he loves to eat poisoned food.

He came to the base onboard the Stan Malay which suffered earlier from a storm upon arrival.

However throughout the entire Arc, he has had all sorts of bad luck from being accused of being a Straw Hat called Condoriano to accidentally helping the Straw Hats numerous times. Shepherd is a grayish skinned man with a ponytail. He normally wears the official Marine over coat and purple clothes. These clothes and a pair of purple eye glasses were stolen by Robin when she assumed his identity. After he was freed from the brig, he regained his clothes but apparently not his eyeglasses. Shepherd thinks himself to be superior over other Marines due to his high rank. He would often threaten others with decommissions, court martial, and such unless his orders as followed or if things don''t go his way. Shepherd thinks lowly of G-8 and it''s commander, Johnathan. He believes that the base and Johnathan are completely useless due the base''s reputation and the Vice Admiral''s methods. Shepherd would thus do anything from writing a bad report to showing off the G-8 Marines just to see the base be decommissioned. Shepherd thinks so low of G-8 that he has refused help from Johnathan when the latter offers him some of the base''s Marines to aid the inspector in locating the Straw Hats. Due to this stubbornness of his, Shepherd has thus done several actions that don''t cooperate with the rest of G-8''s attempts to capture the Straw Hats. The majority of these actions have ended unintentionally helping the Straw Hats out of tight jams. While Shepherd thinks himself to be superior, it has been shown that should the situation arise he shows a more cowardly side. This has been shown most prominent in a discussion between him and Johnathan. During the middle of the discussion, Shepherd decided to toy with Johnathan''s fishing rod in order to mock the Vice Admiral. The normally calm Johnathan however responded to Shepherd''s action in a tone which apparently made the inspector think otherwise. Shepherd''s overall personality is somewhat akin to that of Spandam''s. Shepherd possesses no special abilities or powers per say, however he does possess a special weapon called the Eagle Launcher. This extremely large bazooka is as he says is the latest and greatest portable bazooka that has been developed by the Marine Headquarters. It is as he says like the talons of a bird of prey hence it''s name. It''s power is on par with that of a small battleship. However despite the weapon''s power, Shepherd isn''t exactly an expert on using it. The weapon in fact unintentionally aids the Straw Hats several times than actually destroying them. Upon arrival in G-8, Shepherd is infuriated by having to weather a storm to get to the base and not having anyone welcome him. He refuses to disclose his rank and division to a lower ranked Marine, stating that he is a special VIP from the Marine Headquarters and needs not to disclose such information to the likes of the later. Shepherd then demands an audience with the commander in charge of the base, Johnathan. However due to the base''s motto concerning food, Shepherd is denied it until the Vice Admiral finishes his lunch. Regardless, Shepherd decides to go to the Command Center by himself with plans to relieve Johnathan of his command with his report. However as soon as he walks into a hallway, he is attacked by Nico Robin, who assumes his identity after hiding him. Shepherd is identified as Condoriano by Usopp When he is later discovered, he is thought to be a member of the Straw Hat Pirates, with Usopp claiming he is really named Condoriano and he had lost his memory.[4] After some ruckus caused by the Straw Hats in the base, which included Robin as being identified as a Straw Hat in disguise, Shepherd''s real identity is revealed and he is freed from prison. With all that''s happened, Shepherd decides to take matters in his own hands in order to belittle Johnathan and the rest of G-8 when he learns the Straw Hats would come to retrieve their gold that had been confiscated earlier.[6] He does so regardless of the Stan Malay''s captain''s request to let their troops recover from the wounds they suffered from the storm. With his men, Shepherd confronts four of the Straw Hats that had been conered in the G-8 vault. With the intent of paying back the humiliation that was inflicted on him, Shepherd decides to handle the situation himself disregarding a fellow Marine''s warning to not underestimate the Straw Hats. He then pulls out an extremely large bazooka, the Eagle Launcher and aims at the Straw Hats. However due to a mistake in holding the weapon in the wrong position, he instead fires it backwards. With a little help from Robin''s ability, Shepherd''s own weapon is then used on his own men and then later used to propel himself into the air. With Shepherd himself and the other Marines in the room temporarily knocked down by the Eagle Launcher, the four Straw Hats escape from them. With that, Shepherd then decides to execute his next tactic against the Straw Hats. With his forces on the Pine Peak, he orders them to intercept the Going Merry at the G-8 sea gate and sink it before the pirates before they could escape. Unfortunately this plan too goes wrong. The Pine Peak unintentionally showed the Straw Hats where the current was wherein they could steer Merry, which was disguised as a Marine battleship then. Shepherd''s plan was then once again thwarted as the rest of Going Merry''s disguise collided with the Pine Peak. Believing that the Straw Hats were finally going to escape, Shepherd decided to leave the rest to Johnathan''s forces. Should the Vice Admiral fail to capture them, Shepherd threatened to hold Johnathan for everything that''s happened. However in response, Johnathan simply replied to the Inspector to include in his report himself as being a hindrance in G-8''s operations to capture the pirates. Shepherd then witnesses the base''s special 9 o''clock low tide trap the Going Merry. Fearing that he will become nothing more than a nuisance in the whole affair, Shepherd snuck away from Johnathan and decides to use the Eagle Launcher on the Straw Hats one last time. However upon trying to aim at Luffy while the ship had become airborne thanks to Usopp''s Impact Dial and the Octopus Balloon, Shepherd accidently shot the turret that was aiming at the octopus. His actions unfortunately aids the Straw Hats in escaping. After the incident, Shepherd returns to Johnathan and threatens to decommission the Vice Admiral for allowing the pirates to escape regardless of the fact that Johnathan is Admiral Akainu''s protege. He is however met with Jessica, Johnathan''s wife, punching him out in the face. As the Straw Hats leave G-8, and Johnathan and his wife laugh off the events that had happened, a knocked out Shepherd simply lies on the ground.')

Regardless, Shepherd decides to go to the Command Center by himself with plans to relieve Johnathan of his command with his report. However as soon as he walks into a hallway, he is attacked by Nico Robin, who assumes his identity after hiding him. Shepherd is identified as Condoriano by Usopp When he is later discovered, he is thought to be a member of the Straw Hat Pirates, with Usopp claiming he is really named Condoriano and he had lost his memory.[4] After some ruckus caused by the Straw Hats in the base, which included Robin as being identified as a Straw Hat in disguise, Shepherd''s real identity is revealed and he is freed from prison. With all that''s happened, Shepherd decides to take matters in his own hands in order to belittle Johnathan and the rest of G-8 when he learns the Straw Hats would come to retrieve their gold that had been confiscated earlier.[6] He does so regardless of the Stan Malay''s captain''s request to let their troops recover from the wounds they suffered from the storm. With his men, Shepherd confronts four of the Straw Hats that had been conered in the G-8 vault. With the intent of paying back the humiliation that was inflicted on him, Shepherd decides to handle the situation himself disregarding a fellow Marine''s warning to not underestimate the Straw Hats. He then pulls out an extremely large bazooka, the Eagle Launcher and aims at the Straw Hats. However due to a mistake in holding the weapon in the wrong position, he instead fires it backwards. With a little help from Robin''s ability, Shepherd''s own weapon is then used on his own men and then later used to propel himself into the air. With Shepherd himself and the other Marines in the room temporarily knocked down by the Eagle Launcher, the four Straw Hats escape from them. With that, Shepherd then decides to execute his next tactic against the Straw Hats. With his forces on the Pine Peak, he orders them to intercept the Going Merry at the G-8 sea gate and sink it before the pirates before they could escape. Unfortunately this plan too goes wrong. The Pine Peak unintentionally showed the Straw Hats where the current was wherein they could steer Merry, which was disguised as a Marine battleship then. Shepherd''s plan was then once again thwarted as the rest of Going Merry''s disguise collided with the Pine Peak. Believing that the Straw Hats were finally going to escape, Shepherd decided to leave the rest to Johnathan''s forces. Should the Vice Admiral fail to capture them, Shepherd threatened to hold Johnathan for everything that''s happened. However in response, Johnathan simply replied to the Inspector to include in his report himself as being a hindrance in G-8''s operations to capture the pirates. Shepherd then witnesses the base''s special 9 o''clock low tide trap the Going Merry. Fearing that he will become nothing more than a nuisance in the whole affair, Shepherd snuck away from Johnathan and decides to use the Eagle Launcher on the Straw Hats one last time. However upon trying to aim at Luffy while the ship had become airborne thanks to Usopp''s Impact Dial and the Octopus Balloon, Shepherd accidently shot the turret that was aiming at the octopus. His actions unfortunately aids the Straw Hats in escaping. After the incident, Shepherd returns to Johnathan and threatens to decommission the Vice Admiral for allowing the pirates to escape regardless of the fact that Johnathan is Admiral Akainu''s protege. He is however met with Jessica, Johnathan''s wife, punching him out in the face. As the Straw Hats leave G-8, and Johnathan and his wife laugh off the events that had happened, a knocked out Shepherd simply lies on the ground.' WHERE name = 'Shepherd';

When he came to senses, he decided that he would search for a devil fruit Mera-Mera no mi. Sabo is the Chief of Staff of the Revolutionary Army, and the adopted brother of Monkey D. Luffy and Portgas D. Ace, as well as the son of Outlook III. He is recognized as the "No. 2" of the Revolutionary Army and the second in command under Dragon himself. In chapter 744, Sabo eats the Mera-Mera no Mi and becomes its new user. Egghead Arc Spoilers : On the fourth day of the Levely, Sabo and his group battled Fujitora and Ryokugyu to rescue Kuma. The mission was a success and he and his group escaped Mary Geoise. Sabo was alleged to have also assassinated Nefertari Cobra, the king of the Alabasta Kingdom, in the process. During the rescue mission, Sabo ending up being separated from the rest of the commanders, and he went to hide in Lulusia Kingdom. Sabo managed to contact the Revolutionary Army, but due to not using a White Den Den Mushi to jam his signals due to time constraints, it led the Marines to intercept it. Sabo affirmed to his fellow Revolutionaries that he wasn''t the one who killed Cobra. However, before he could fully report his findings of the Empty Throne to them, Im destroyed Lulusia and the Five Elders ordered the Marines to forget the interception, and claimed that Lulusia never existed to begin with.'

Unlike his former friend Inuarashi, Nekomamushi is aggressive and merciless. Inuarashi has described him as an "obstinate and stubborn imbecile," comparing him to Jack himself. Nekomamushi can be stubborn even when not angry, as he kept ignoring Chopper''s orders to recuperate in order to have fun. He does not like to be ordered around, as shown when he stated that he went to bed of his own volition rather than on Chopper''s orders, and describes himself as a "freedom-loving man." Despite his bravado, he is shown to be afraid of needles. He took care of Bepo and the other Heart Pirates when they arrived on Zou, indicating a welcoming personality.. He does not expect guests to help him defend Zou. However, he does not look kindly upon intruders, going so far as to devour them if he ever sees one. Just like a cat, he likes to lick his paws, play with balls and cat toys, and eat catnip. Unlike most cats, however, he loves taking baths. His favourite food is lasagne' WHERE name = 'Nekomamushi';

His face was long and unshaven, and he had pink and blue hair slicked upward at the front. He wore a dark blue jacket with tasseled, ice cream-shaped pauldrons and a thick belt with his initials, "SM" printed on the buckle over a striped suit. As the Minister of Gelato, Moscato was in charge of procuring and distributing gelato to whoever needed it, and had authority over an unknown island of Totto Land. He was able to jump back and dodge one of his mother''s punches, though he was otherwise powerless to stop her rampage. Moscato carried a long sword with a handle shaped like an ice cream cone on his back. Moscato cared about Sweet City and attempted to prevent his mother from eating it during one of her craving-induced rampages.

She wears a large skirt with green and white stripes that has a large number of black frills lining the bottom and wears green tights as well as green heels. She wears two bows, both of which are orange on the right side and have yellow and green stripes on the left. One bow is on the top of her head, while the other is on the back of her skirt. Ann is a kind but ditzy girl. She quickly made friends with the Straw Hat Pirates, and she also is thoughtful enough to have asked Luffy if he wanted to see Ace again. However, she often gets easily distracted and forgets what she is doing until others remind her, including when she is performing or asking for help Ann has a bright, spunky personality and puts a lot of spirit into her announcing during the Pirates Expo. She is not shy about her bias, actively cheering for Luffy and his crew. She is also somewhat of a diva in personality, getting frustrated at her co-announcer Donald Moderate for cutting off her sentences and stealing his microphone to goad her ego. Ann ate the Bijo Bijo no Mi, a Paramecia-class Devil Fruit that allows the user to create "phantoms," or illusory images, by touching pictures. She can create phantoms of objects, plants, and even people that can then interact with their environment. One Piece: Phantom Ann returned to Tongari Island and put on a special homecoming concert at Live Music Club TONGARI. DJ Parrot introduced Ann and her abilities and welcomed her to the stage. She began to perform, but the Straw Hat Pirates, except for Robin, Franky, and Brook, came to see her perform, she interacted with them and forgot that she was performing. She continued to perform after the pirates reminded her, demonstrating her powers by creating phantoms of a bunch of flowers and a group of Kung-Fu Dugongs (Karoo in the second term of the show) on an island. Suddenly, Buggy appeared and captured Ann, explaining that he wanted to use her phantoms to help capture the Straw Hat Pirates and sell them to the Marines. Buggy forced Ann to create phantoms of several of the crew''s allies to confuse them while Puggy apprehended them one by one. Ann was then forced to create a phantom of Sabo to confuse Luffy. Luffy knocked Buggy and Puggy away, freeing Ann and the others. Ann thanked him and offered to create a phantom of Ace. Luffy declined, and they all decide to restart Ann''s concert. As they are singing and dancing together, Buggy returns. Ann creates a phantom of Ace without Luffy''s knowledge, which helps Luffy defeat the Shichibukai member. DJ Parrot announced that the concert will continue, and Ann parts ways with the crew after they finish singing together. One Piece: Marionette Ann was performing another concert on Tongari Island when a resident of the island ran onto the stage, warning her to run. The resident was sprayed with marionette gas by Caesar Clown, and Caesar manipulated the resident to charge at Ann. Before the resident could hurt Ann, Sabo intervened and stopped him. Ann watched as Caesar tricked Sabo into inhaling the gas and ran to find help once Sabo was under Caesar''s control. Ann ran into the Straw Hat Pirates on the island''s beach and asked them for help. Luffy asked her to make a phantom of meat for him, but the rest of the crew reminded her that she had wanted their help. She was about to tell them about Sabo when he attacked them and appeared. Ann watched the crew fight Sabo. After Zoro got sprayed with marionette gas by Caesar, she and Usopp sent Chopper through a secret passageway to the Thousand Sunny to develop an antidote. She continued to watch the fight as Caesar took control of Sanji and Usopp. As the four under Caesar''s control prepared to attack, Luffy asked Ann to create a phantom of Vinsmoke Reiju to remove the poison gas from them.

He later wielded a bow and arrow, which he used to burn down the Owl Library. He also has been shown using a horn to call upon and command his MMAs (Source: One Piece Wiki)' WHERE name = 'Killingham, Rimoshifu';
